Today was a rough day. A research deadline looms yet a persistent bug kills my productivity, despite lacking productivity I fail to go about nice habits such as excercise and side projects such as writing on this site, and on top of all that my brand new expensive laptop decided to die on me.

As has happened before and will happen again, this current sad predicament has given me motivation to take up something I have been meaning to do for a while: writing about meditation. Specifically, my experience with meditation.
