<br>
This is a bit out there. I've only [published one thing](http://www.andreykurenkov.com/writing/life/exceptional-people/) that was at all personal/poetic, which is already unusual for this sort of blog. But it was not as personal as this. So I think a justification is justified. 
<br><br>
I've heard, and broadly agree with, the prevailing and often expressed notion that mental illness should be de-stigmatized. But I've often been annoyed with the ambiguity of expressions of this notion - what's the point of just stating that discussion of mental illness should be de-stigmatized? How does that actually happen? What does that mean, concretely? 
<br><br>
I suppose this is my own answer to that question - part of it means that I should not be ashamed to publicly disclose having gone through depression and its associated side effects if I feel like it. And the truth is, while going through it I did feel awkward about bringing it up. And so I did not share this with my many of my best friends, nor with most of the people I work with. Most of these people would have understood, would have been supportive, but still it felt too awkward to bring up; perhaps the stigma did get to me.
<br><br>
And, turns out, I do feel like publicly disclosing having gone through depression and its associated side effects. Or rather, I feel like writing about depression and in the process disclosing that I've gone through it. And what I feel like writing about is not this whole stigma topic but rather just how alien and twisted living while sick with depression was. I am no expert, I don't know if it's an entirely physical illness or what, but I do know this: it is a condition. It is a state of being utterly distinct from your normal existence. 
<br><br>
So, I want to show that state dissected, spread out, annotated. To point out that this is a profoundly strange and terrible illness that you may not really understand if you've not been through it. And in particular to promote the perspective that it is precisely an illness; easy to recognize if hard to understand, and reliably treatable. I most definitely <b>do not</b> want to [glorify or romanticize](https://www.theodysseyonline.com/tumblr-stop-romanticizing-mental-illnesses) my experience.
<br><br>
When I became healthy again, it took me a few weeks to stop finding the experience of just feeling normal weirdly fascinating. Now, looking back, I find the experience of having been depressed fascinating. You cannot understand it without having gone through it, just as I cannot understand what it is to take acid having not done it. But, perhaps this little essay-poem can give you a bit of insight into that.
<br><br>
And lastly, honestly, the biggest reason this is being posted on my site and you are now reading it is: this thing just sort of started spilling out of me one morning. I spent two hours straight going back and forth between what was initially an empty page until it was many pages, subsequently cried, and could not fall asleep on many days afterward spontaneously thinking of things to add to this. If that's not the sort of writing that deserves to be shared, I don't know what is.
<br><br>

This is how I remember depression [^Clinical]. It was not exactly like this; there were highs, lows, bad days, good days.

But this is how I remember it.  

Tired. So tired. Tired, cold, ambivalent. Anxious, miserable, uncomfortable, unfocused[^Symptoms]. <br>
That's depression. Except, these are just words. Depression cannot be conveyed with just such words.

You know the difference between being single and being in love? <br>The difference between being depressed and being healthy is like that.

You know how when you are drunk, or high, you think thoughts that seem absurd in retrospect? 
<br>That happens all the time, constantly, with depression. Eventually I learned to distrust my 'depressed self'.  

You know how being in a bad mood is like a filter that squeezes out the joy from otherwise pleasant things? 
<br>Imagine being in the worst mood of your life, for months.  

You know how it feels when you are at a social event, and just can't seem to get along with anyone - alienated ? 
<br>Depression makes you feel like that, even among friends.  

You know that feeling of getting in a cold shower and having your body revolt, go 'make this stop'? 
<br>It was like that, every morning, being hit with a wave of misery moments after awakening, like 'oh, right, *this*'. 

You know how nice it is to warm up by a fire after being frozen, and how painful it is to then leave that fire? 
<br>Spending time with friends or family felt like being warmed next to a fire, whose heat soon went away to be replaced by the familiar cold. 

You know the difference between being heartbroken, slogging through life listless and gray, and being normal? 
<br>The first time I felt normal, listening to some pop song in front of a urinal, really truly normal - my old self - I was struck as if I just realized some secret. I suspect the medication fully kicked in. 

You know the difference between feeling dead tired, despondent, ambivalent for all except sleep and the feeling of having just awoken on the first day of a vacation? 
<br>One day I awoke and felt that I really was healed of depression, and it was like that.  

You know the difference between waking up with a killer hangover and having to go to work, and going off home having just exercised? 
<br>Being depressed was like a perpetual hangover, and being healthy again was like having a perpetual dopamine high. 

You know that feeling of being in a conversation with someone droning on about a topic you could not care less about, just wanting it to end? 
<br>Being alive felt like that. I had supportive family, friends, security, prospects. 
<br>But it did not matter. I still had suicidal thoughts[^SideEffect].

That's depression. Except, here's the thing: it was not a feeling. It was a state, a condition, a sickness. <br>A sickness I was stuck with.

It was as if I was not longer really myself. 
<br>I did not have interests, energy, drive - all that was left was a dull miserable husk of who I knew myself to be. 

It was as if I was just play-acting as Andrey. 
<br>The play-acting came pretty naturally, though. 

It was like I could no longer see a future. 
<br>I wanted nothing, was incapable of wanting to strive for anything, dreamed only of spending months in the darkness of my parent's basement. The past haunted me, every single misstep real or imaginary.

It was like being up high and struggling for breath every single moment, or underwater holding your breath.
<br> I thought about thinking about suicide - it became mundane and tiresome. 

It was like sleep was my only goal, my only escape. Every day. 
<br>I just wanted to close my eyes. I just wanted to lie down still in a dark silent room.  

[It was like life was just a thing that I did.](https://youtu.be/IHnHpX77oKs). 

It was like every time I listened to music, there was this horrible droning static,.
<br> The music that once brought me joy just added to the static. 

It was like I was some Dickensian street urchin, scraping by for every piece of happiness. 
<br>Every free meal I got felt like an odd victory that I devoured. 

It was like life had become some modern piece of art, inscrutable and cold, nonsensical. 
<br>Life never felt more absurd, more grotesque, more pointless [^Absurd].  

It was like I was in Purgatory. Not Hell you see, this was not pain or punishment, it was depression. 
<br>I meditated, exercised, socialized, went for long walks, read, watched movies. 
<br>None of it healed me, but it helped.  

It was like a dream where you walk around in a snow storm wearing only your t-shirt and shorts, in a big cold city surrounded by towering gray skyscrapers. 
<br>And somehow this is supposed to make sense.  

That's depression. A surreal, absurd sickness. One of the most common forms of sickness there is[^Common].

Except it did make sense, just not to my sick mind. I was sick. I needed treatment. I got it, and got better. Most dont[^Treatment]. 

It did make sense. I had stress, burnout, family history [^Family], prior episodes [^Recurrence], failures, mistakes, changes; so much to explain it. I knew it was a sickness, involuntary, not my fault. I still felt ashamed, felt like I had allowed myself to fall to a stupid first world 'illness' [^FirstWorld].  

It was like the world had become overesaturated, loud, grotesque. Really, I tried Friends and found it so unimaginably grating, loud, grotesque.

Given my privilge and my positive position, I truly believe this can happen to anyone whetther unfortunate or unwise.  [anumbers]

The melancholy of depression is not melancholy, is not beautiful, it is annoying, it is sick, it is stupid, it is something I hate and fear like few other things. 

To get somewhere you need above all to want to get there. I wanted nothing.

And you know, actually, honestly, trying to seem normal was part of the agony. 

I should have gone to the psychotherapist earlier, at least a month earlier. But I was wary of medication, and there there the fleeting times I felt I was dealing with it well enough. Not really like a broken arm. 

I am still taking antidepressants. It's next taper off. 
 
I am still seeing a therapist. Clearly I was not infected by this sickness by someone else. 

I used to love life, I used to relish being myself. Depression took that way from me. 
<br>But now I have it back. Now I am no longer depressed.

Having healed, my nightames mostly revolve around variations on not having truly healed.

Having healed, I wonder

Having healed, music sounds as sweet as wine - it's indescribable.

Having healed, my energy and enthusiasm are boundless.

Having healed, I was taken aback by my therapist having asked about suicidal thoughts - 'oh right... not any for weeks.' It did not even occur to me.

Having healed, I write this, reflecting on that period of surreal sickness.

Having healed, what I remember most vividly is not the suicidal thoughts, the inability to focus, the anxiety, the shame; what I remember most is lying down in darkness and silence in my room at 8PM, and feeling like there was nothing at all that could make me feel better except doing that - that sensation of wanting absolutely nothing else but this quiet, this stillness. 

Having healed, I see the need to de-stigamatize, and to share my knowledge far more than I did before[^Stigma]. 

Don't feel bad for me. I seriously feel superhuman, healed of this sickness. Just, try to understand.  

<hr>
If during reading this you felt you related and may be going through depression, *please* seek consulation with a mental health professional and talk to your friends and family. When I was depressed it felt like it was never going to end, but it did, and I fully attribute seeking treatment and support as the cause for my recovery.

<hr>
[^Clinical]: That is, [clinical](https://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/major-depression#1 ) depression, which I was diagnosed with having
[^Symptoms]: And these were just my symptoms. <br>The [list goes on](https://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/detecting-depression#1):  <br>Fatigue, <br>Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, and helplessness, <br>Pessimism and hopelessness, <br>Insomnia, early-morning wakefulness, or sleeping too much, <br>Irritability, <br>Restlessness, <br>Loss of interest in things once pleasurable, including sex, <br>Overeating, or appetite loss, <br>Aches, pains, headaches, or cramps that won't go away, <br>Digestive problems that don't get better, even with treatment, <br>Persistent sad, anxious, or "empty" feelings, <br>Suicidal thoughts or attempts.
[^SideEffect]: Although it is weird to consider thoughts a side effect of illness, [it's true](https://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/depression-recognizing-signs-of-suicide#1): "Over 90% of people who die by suicide have clinical depression or another diagnosable mental disorder."
[^Absurd]: I had been prone to existential dread in the past, but the sheer nauseating sense of [The Absurd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism) was abhorrent; I felt exactly like [Sisyphus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_Sisyphus): "life is meaningless and nonsensical, but humans strive constantly for meaning and sense in it... Once stripped of its common romanticism, the world is a foreign, strange and inhuman place."
[^Treatment]: [Most who really need treatment don't get it](http://time.com/3615353/depression-seeking-treatment/): <br>But what was most concerning to study co-author Laura Pratt, an epidemiologist at the NCHS, was that 65% of people with severe symptoms of depression were not getting help from a mental health professional.“The fact that people aren’t getting treatment is disturbing,” she says. “People with severe depression should be getting therapy from a mental health professional, and they should also in a lot of cases be on a more complicated medication regimen that requires a psychiatrist to treat them. The fact that only 35% have seen a mental health professional in the last year was pretty alarming.”
[^Family]: [Family history](https://www.healthline.com/health/depression/genetic#genetics): "Research has also shown that people with parents or siblings who have depression are up to three times more likely to have the condition."
[^Common]: [common](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2169519/): "Major Depressive Disorder is one of the most common forms of psychopathology, one that will affect approximately one in six men and one in four women in their lifetimes. 
[^Recurrence]: [Recurrence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2169519/): "[Major depressive disorder] is usually highly recurrent, with at least 50% of those who recover from first episode of depression having one or more additional episodes in their lifetime, and approximately 80% of those with a history of two episodes having another recurrence."
[^FirstWorld]: Which, by the way, [is inaccurate](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/11/07/a-stunning-map-of-depression-rates-around-the-world/?utm_term=.0a6535d7a636)
[^Stigma]: And it's not just a hunch either - from ["The Impact of Mental Illness Stigma on Seeking and Participating in Mental Health Care
"](http://journals.sagepub.com/stoken/rbtfl/dDpyhM2zRi.Fg/full): "Mental health literacy seems to have a promising effect on care seeking. Individuals who better recognize their mental illness and its manifestations, as well as treatment options to address its varied impressions, might better avail themselves of those options (Jorm, 2012)."
