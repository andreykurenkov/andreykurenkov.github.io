excerpt: The significantly outdated justification for this blog.
---
<p>This blog exists because I have a lot of things to say, and particularly a lot of things to say this summer as I do research on a crazy thing called “memristors” in Switzerland. Alas, short quippy social media posts are no longer sufficient to express all these things I have to say, things some people may actually want to read! So, I shall put those things here, including but not limited to: interesting papers discovered in research, the progress of my multiple secret side projects, essays on various things related to art, and various intellectual nonsense. Maybe I’ll even figure out how to make these things interesting in the process.</p>
