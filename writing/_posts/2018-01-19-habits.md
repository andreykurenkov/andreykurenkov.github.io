Here's a quote you might know - 

> "We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit." (
-Aristotle (except actually [Will Durant](http://blogs.umb.edu/quoteunquote/2012/05/08/its-a-much-more-effective-quotation-to-attribute-it-to-aristotle-rather-than-to-will-durant/)

I have known this quote for some time. But, somehow it took me until fairly recently to seriously take stock of my time management and habits. In Undergrad my time management could be boiled down to "do the next thing", and I did not have habits export for keeping up with work and occasionally excercising. I kept adding work until it was just about too much, and then did whatever needed doing to keep up.

Turns out, that's not a great way to go about things. After graduating, I had a glut of free time on my hands I started consistently drinking [Soylent](http://www.andreykurenkov.com/writing/life/some-thoughts-on-meditation/). I took up [meditation](http://www.andreykurenkov.com/writing/life/some-thoughts-on-meditation/).
