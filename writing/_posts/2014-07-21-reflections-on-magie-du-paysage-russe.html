excerpt: How it was to connect to my Russian roots, while in Switzerland
---
<p>Many weeks before this blog existed, I was exploring around Lausanne for the first time with a relaxed meandering gait when suddenly my brain was excited to be informed by my eyes that some light bouncing off of Russian text was hitting them. My eyes darted towards these unexpected words amid the sea of French, and I saw that it was a poster advertising this:</p>

<p>This was strange for me. , and set out in search of a national, realistic, romantic art, appropriate for conveying the special characteristics of the 'Russian soul'."</p>

<p>So I was intrigued. 'd have a stronger reaction to a bunch of paintings than I have had in the past.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="794"]<img src="images/ad9a1115b7.jpg" alt="" width="794" height="600" /> The painting that set the tone for the rest of the exhibit  (Ivan Chichkine, In the forest of Countess Mordinova of Peterhof)[/caption]</p>
<p>When I got to the museum, I was getting a bit tired of hearing and seeing French I could not comprehend all the time, and of the small confusing situations I got myself into due to the inability to speak said language (magnified by my resonant awkwardness).  So then, it was a relief that when the man who took my ticket started saying further information in incomprehensible French, a Russian who could translate happened to be passing by. The Russian remarked it was "a wonderful exhibition" before moving on, and then, naturally, I entered this wonderful exhibition. The first room had "лес" written in large text on a mildly green wall, and the paintings above and below, and the power to make me contemplate the Russian soul as captured in these paintings.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="562"]<img src="images/returning-from-the-woods-nikolai-pimonenko-1900.jpg" alt="" width="562" height="768" /> The expression of this woman says it all (Return  the Forest, Nikolai Pimonenko)[/caption]</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I did not go through any particularly touching experience in this museum. But I did engage with these paintings more than I  soul stuff, which incidentally is also not something I wrote this to talk about.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="1024"]<img src="images/47ded-ivanconstantinovichaivazovsky-stormysea.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="836" /> The sea paintings captured it's strength like no film I have seen (Agitated Sea, Ivan Aivazovski)[/caption]</p>
<p>What I did write this to talk about  becomes increasingly digital, it was refreshing to look through these analog pieces from the past that were best seen without any silicon being involved. Though I can only hope the future of virtual reality will obliterate that thought, for now I can still suggest you consider going to some nearby art gallery to have a contemplative little date with art of your own - after all, it'll probably be time better spent than the internet browsing you would undertake otherwise.</p>
