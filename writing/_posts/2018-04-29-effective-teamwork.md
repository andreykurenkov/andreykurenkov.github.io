How this happened: I was helping out a team of undergrads and finding myself frustrated with their workflow.
Then it occured to me my many years of experience with big team projects, professional software engineering, and grad-level research have 
led me to have some pretty strong beliefs about how effective teamwork ought to be done. 

So below is a one-page summary of all the lessons I have learned having done these many team projects (and having been a culprit in bad teammwork innumerable times). Enjoy!
