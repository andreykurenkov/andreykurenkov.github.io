Some time ago, I wrote [a post](http://www.andreykurenkov.com/writing/in-my-head-music-videos-i-dont-forget/) that was little more than a list of music videos I have long remembered for being great. What compelled me to write such a thing, rather than the sort of essay and technical post I usually peddle, is that there really was a discrete number of music videos that stuck with me and seemed to represent the best of the medium. And so it is with a medium not so dissimilar from the music video - the trailer. 

The similarities are obvious - like music videos, trailers almost always last only a few minutes, are also free to not represent reality but bound to reflect another piece of art, and also tend to make a strong aesthetic impression with imagery and sound. But, of course they also have a practical purpose music videos do not have - to inform you about the nature of some movie and make you want to watch it. This makes it so that a great majority of trailers take up a fairly predictable form, like the one above, and so not really as inventive and original as music videos.

Still, I have come across many trailers in my life that impressed not just because they made me want to watch the movie, but just because the trailer itself was so impressively made. As stated in ["The Art of First Impressions: How to Cut a Movie Trailer"](http://filmmakermagazine.com/37093-first-impressions/#.VypVA14oBC0), a trailer is its own film - it has rhythm, appeal, and impact that are distinct even from the movie it is based on. Thinking back on the trailers that made the greatest lasting impression on me, I noticed they tended to fit into one of a few styles that that differed from the above 'conventional' trailer. And so, read on for those greatest trailers stuck in my head as well as the styles it occured to me they exemplify.

## The Music Over Montage Trailer

This is my favorite style of trailer, perhaps because it tends to least resemble advertising and most function as its own work of art. The cutting together of footage without any continuity, and the muting of dialogue in favor of a single musical track, together almost completely dissasociate the images from the movie they are from. Instead, the audio track and spliced footage make for a new composition that can be quite different from the movie while hinting at it's overall mood and spirit. 

I think this is particularly true of the above trailer; The Double is a slow dark comedy about heady themes concerning our need to be acknowledged, but you could hardly guess that from the trailer alone. The normal exposition about themes and characters is totally absent, and about the only thing that is conveyed is the creepy surreal aspect of the doppleganger and the fantastic visual style. It is not telling us what the movie *will* be about, who these charcters *will* be, but just *is* its own little film representing the style and spirit of the whole movie. Of course, this is also why this style is reserved for teaser and not 'real' trailers that actually need to explain what the movie is about. Still, this style of trailer has been used for some very noteworthy movies:

	<figcaption>The trailer for Alien. This is even more its own thing than the others, as it includes footage not at all in the movie.  </figcaption>

## The Single Track Trailer
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7iggyFPls4w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

A similar but distinct style, in which a single track of dialogue or beat is repeated and intensified over a montage of unrelated footage. It is not quite as divorced from the movie as the previous style, since it is typically the main character monologuing and there may be some cuts to dialogue, but is still far less expository than the likes of the Independnece Day trailer. And, crucially, these trailers can also include an element entirely not in the movie. In the above trailer, the continuous blackboard beat and repeated scenes are elements unique to the trailer - not from the movie. And then there is Inception's [now ubiquitous BRAAAM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=830I9w7I7wM), which was [in fact conceived](http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/who-really-created-the-inception-braaam-composer-mike-zarin-sets-the-record-straight-20131113) for the teaser trailer rather than for the movie itself.

## The Condensed Movie Trailer

Sometimes, just taking all the best elements of a movie and succintly showing them off works wonders. This may sound like pretty much every trailer out there, but it takes skill to do well, and is doomed to fail if the movie has nothing interesting going on to begin with. These trailers do more than just introduce the characters and plot of their movie - they simultaneously weave together the strongest elements of the movie, leave out just enough to keep the viewer interested, and have just enough editing flourish to be entertaining apart from the footage they contain.  

The above trailer for The Double is wholly different from the teaser in that it introduces the characters and plot at length. But it does more than that - it combines multiple songs from the movie's memorable score, shows off the doubles' dichotomy, and builds to an incredibely energetic conclusion that combines moments from multiple distinct scenes in the source. The following trailers, too, combine exposition with a melding of multiple scenes that is not found in the movie but represents its unique strengths:

## The Cinematic Video Game Trailer

It should be clear that the above three styles represent increasing levels of exposition about and representation of their source materials. But, trailers don't only exist for movies. They exist for video games as well, and for video games there is a unique style of trailer that is literally a wholly distinct work of art - the cinematic trailer. Usually these short films are not much more than eye candy, but in some cases - as in these cases - they are quite good short films in their own right. I have seen the above Deus Ex trailer many times now, purely because I think it is marvelously conceived and executed.

Advertisements are often seen as something to instinctively avoid these days, as something tasteless that intrudes into our lives only to cause annoyane. But, when the ad can be this good looking, this well produced, this distinctly artistic - then I can only hope to see more like it.
