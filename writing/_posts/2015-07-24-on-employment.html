<p><strong>Why Most Don't Relish Work</strong></p>
<p>This view,  I think, is fairly uncharacteristic.</p>

<p>"life outside of work is important, but millennials also care about what they do at work.<br />
Our research shows that millennials will trade off a high salary for a more fulfilling<br />
career. For millennials, fulfillment is about enjoying what they do — but it’s also about<br />
helping to make the world a better place. These young workers want to make a<br />
difference whether it’s inside or outside the office. Pew Research Center’s 2010 study<br />
found that 57 percent of millennials had volunteered in the previous year — more than<br />
any other generation. Millennials think social consciousness shouldn’t be separate from<br />
the workplace, but a part of it."</p>
