##Welcome

Hello there. Liking the site? Fun fact: the publication date of this post is also the date that *andreykurenkov.com* went live on the wild lands of the internet. Fun fact \#2: it's been more than a year since I originally started working on it. Why do it? To learn the basics of web development, since I had not done any of at the time, and to document my miscellaneous projects, but most of all simply to build something that felt like a space that of my own to express my thoughts through (inspired significantly by the magnificent [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/)). And why did it take a year to get finished? Well, like I said, I had not done **any** web development before starting to build my own site. Following the Django tutorial was easy enough, but wrangling HTML and CSS to fullfil my lofty vision proved significantly harder, and having to figure out how to use jQuery was the cherry on top of the technological stack pie.

And so I got far in that summer, learned the Django and prototyped a static portfolio page in HTML and CSS, but ultimately stopped at the 80% point and got distracted by college. And then, as tends to happen, the project hibernated for a good long while before I got back to it during the bliss of Winter Break. But, as tends to happen, I then got it to the 95% point - the point at which all major problems are solved and interesting functionality implemented - but lacked the will to do the remaining 5% (content entry and bothersome debugging). Meanwhile, my plentiful (but also insufficient) free time allowed me to also create the significantly less ambitious [lifeofandrey.wordpress.com](www.lifeofandrey.wordpress.com), for which all the content of this site prior to this was written. Fast forward past a whole lot of life living

##TODO
* Create projects category to replace work in nav bar and be distinct from writing  
  I have a ton of neat half-finished or even finished projects that I would enjoy documenting,
if only to reminisce on their creation. LinkedIn only shows my long-lasting efforts and achievements,
and Github is hardly fun to explore. These will be somewhat like the quasi-essay under writing,
but will have a more involved layout with images - much like my old Django-based site.
* Create custom Photography pages instead of linking to 500px
  Though 500px is a fine site I quite enjoy browsing, it's not fun to just link to it instead of 
hosting the photographs myself. Luckily, a neat hidden little feature of Lightroom is static
