## Why Write This
Here's a quote you might know - 

> "We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit." <br>
-Aristotle (except actually [Will Durant](http://blogs.umb.edu/quoteunquote/2012/05/08/its-a-much-more-effective-quotation-to-attribute-it-to-aristotle-rather-than-to-will-durant/))

Makes sense right? Of course. I have known this quote for some time. But, somehow it took me until recently to seriously take stock of my time management and habits. In high school and undergrad, when I first started undertaking seriously big workloads and being significantly in charge of how to spend time, my time management could be boiled down to "do the next thing". I more or less kept adding work until it was just about too much, and then did whatever needed doing to keep up. My habits could be summarized as keeping up with work and occasionally excercising, but otherwise it was very much like continuously improvising my daily plan.

Turns out, that's not a great way to go about things. After graduating, I had a glut of free time on my hands and little idea of what to do with it all. Work for classes, team projects, research, all of that had nice clear deadlines that fit nicely into my 'keep up' lifestlyle.  But with all that being over I found no more easy answers as to what to do and when to do it. So I started reflected on [why I worked so much](http://www.andreykurenkov.com/writing/life/on-work/), and decided that it was because I wanted to do a lot of things, and that I still wanted to do a lot of things - to write stuff for this site, do more photography, do side projects, practice boxing, work on being healthier, etc. 

So, I started blocking out time for all these things and becoming slightly more methodical about doing things at regular times and places. It was around this time that I first took on multiple habits that I keep up with to this day - I [started](http://www.andreykurenkov.com/writing/life/on-employment/) [undertaking](http://www.andreykurenkov.com/writing/art/movie-recommendations-for-the-aspiring-eclectic-intellectual/) [more](http://www.andreykurenkov.com/writing/ai/a-brief-history-of-neural-nets-and-deep-learning/) [ambitious](http://www.andreykurenkov.com/writing/ai/organizing-my-emails-with-a-neural-net/) [writing](http://www.andreykurenkov.com/writing/ai/a-brief-history-of-game-ai/), [drinking Soylent for lunch](http://www.andreykurenkov.com/writing/art/why-i-consume-soylent/), [meditation](http://www.andreykurenkov.com/writing/life/some-thoughts-on-meditation/). On top of that, I started using [HabitBull](http://www.habitbull.com/) to try and train myself to keep up with these habits.

Skip forward a few years. I no longer have a glut of free time - being a grad student at Stanford keeps me plenty busy. But I still want to do all this stuff, the blog writing, the being healthy, all of it. And so last year was when it finally hit me that I need to double down on this habits and routine thing - rather than the loose sort of regularity I have cultivated, I needed to habits with discipline. My no calendar, no todo list, no consistency lifestlye will not work anymore. In order to keep up with all the aspects of my type A life, I needed to start following a routine. I needed to establish habits, and stick to them, or else I'll always feel behind and overwhelmed with planning how to get ahead. 

I have not changed completely. Not even close. My work style is still pretty chaotic, and I am not even close to having a consistent routine or set of habits. But I've made a lot of progress, and in so doing have come to think that at least for my engineer/researcher/student sort of life this kind of mindful reflection on one's habits and routine is essential. And this being my little corner of the internet, and ostensibely meant to be a reflection of my thoughts on my engineer/researcher/student sort of life, it only makes sense that

Why? It took me a while to figure this all out. Hopefully, if anyone is so bored as to read this, it'll benefit you in figuring it out earlier. 
So, enough build up. A reflection of the habits I've already cultivated, and why I value them, and the habits that I now plan to cultivate, and why I plan to do so.  

## The Habits

### Sleep

#### Old: get enough sleep
When I've described my often surprising workloads, people have often asked me 'how much do you sleep' or commented that I must sleep very little. No. Going back many years, to at least the sophemore year of college, I recognized the importance of sleep and the stupidity of all nighters. This may have translated to averaging only 7 or 6 hours most weeks - but average 7 or 6 hours I did. 

#### New: wake up consistently
This is a tough one. Since the end of high school, I have never managed to wake up at a consistent time. Not even when I started working as a software engineer - my initial enthusiasm for showing up early quickly faded and I went back to winging it based on how I felt on the day. Turns out, not waking up at a consistent time makes it hard to have a consistent morning routine, and a morning routine is pretty important for having a routine at all. And, it makes it harder to wake up at all. So, time for fancy alarm clocks, 

### Excercise

#### Old: Boxing,Fitstar
You know what's great? Fitness classes. Seriously, I've not once excercised as rigorously by myself as when led by a good instructor. Practically every time I went to a boxing gym I felt that I was unable to keep up 

You know what else is great? Not having to go to the gym to excercise. All one needs to excercise is a hard floor ; though a mat helps nicely. Going back even to my undergrad days, I was often unable to make it to the gym. But not making it to the gym does not mean I did not excercise; FitStar (Nike, skimble)

#### New: Morning Kick Off
All too often, work would get heavy, I would have to pick my battles, and I'd miss the gym for days, even weeks. That does not feel good, seem good, or is good. So my new idea? Excercise for 10-15 minutes right upon waking up. 

### Diet

#### Old: Soylent
I already [made my case for Soylent](http://www.andreykurenkov.com/writing/art/why-i-consume-soylent/) (TDLR - convenient, healthy, affordable, futuristic, makes real food taste even better), and years later the case still holds up. More than holds up, actually - with the introduction of Soylent 2.0 and Soylent Coffee and Cocoa, the convenience and flavor have both seen a significant boost in the past few years. Most I tell this still scoff, but whenever I am so inconvenienced as to have to eat real food for lunch I 

#### New: Meal squares
But, let's face it, drinking two bottles of nutritious goo can get a bit repititious. So, I was most excited by my recent discovery of MealSquares. These little nutirition bricks are dry, dense, and chalky - but also contain bits of chocolate, and go down fantastically when paired with a drink such as tea (or Soylent!).

### Mental Wellness

#### Old: Meditation
This too, [I have written about](http://www.andreykurenkov.com/writing/life/some-thoughts-on-meditation/). More and more, I am convinced that meditation will gradually become as commonly acknowledged as a crucial component of a healthy life as physical excercise. Nowdays it's easier than ever to start - Calm, Headspace. Insight Timer. 

#### New: Gratitude Journaling
