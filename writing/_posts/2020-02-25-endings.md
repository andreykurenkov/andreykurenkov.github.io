excerpt: "A little poem about endings"
---
That last drag of a cigarette,  
or last drink in a bar,   
or last shot at a party,  
That last song at a concert,  
or last shot in a movie,  
or last line of a novel,  
That last day of a trip,  
or last hour before a flight,  
or last night in a country,  
That last hug in a relationship,  
or last email for a job,  
or last kiss of a couple,  
That last hour of a night,  
or last image of a dream,  
or last breath of a life,  
Those last moments,  
Followed by,  
exultation,  
or grief,  
or boredom,  
So profound,  
And yet,  
Life goes on,  
And beginnings follow
