excerpt: "A recollection of my favorite video game works of art"
---
Video games get a bad rep - that they are still mostly flashy dopamine drips or immature Michael Bay-inspired toys for teenage boys,
and not interesting works of art of like those made by, say, Kubrick or Faulkner.  And to be fair the preponderance of shallow uninspired shooters,
uninspired shallow phone games, and nineteenth-in-the-franchise game releases does mean the rep still has some merit. But not much. Rather, the 
prepondarance of traditional or shallow games can be seen as a sign of how large and commercially mature the medium has grown, and the ever 
relevant truth of [Sturgeon's_law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon's_law). 

Like many at my age I started playing video games when I was young, and still play them. Like far fewer at my age, I have grown to be very fond of let-say ambitious and challenging (or as some would say, pretentious) art by the likes of Kubrick or Faulkner. Ambitious cinema, ambitious literature, and yes, ambitious video games. Though still not as mature as those other media of art, video games have nevertheless matured immensely in my lifetime. There is now no shortage of games with strong a strong focus on narrative and thematic depth, experimental ideas that explore the potential of interactive art, and just downright beautiful works of the sort that define how exciting art can be.
 
So while I still enjoy the occasional big-budget-little-more-than-dopamine-drip AAA game, and while I still truly love some profoundly well made 
pure-game video games, the games that occupy my memories and thoughts the most are those ambitious ones. As with my [previous little write-up on my favorite 'artistic' works of a whole artistic medium](/writing/movie-recommendations-for-the-aspiring-eclectic-intellectual/), I now feel compelled to meander about my memories and thoughts of these games and share them with the world.

Few of my art-cinema-or-literature-loving-friends are into playing them, and few of my
