excerpt: "A recollection of my favorite video game works of art"
---
Video games get a bad rep - that they are still mostly flashy dopamine drips or immature Michael Bay-inspired toys for teenage boys, and never interesting or ambitious works of art of like those made by, say, Kubrick or Faulkner. 
And to be fair the preponderance of shallow uninspired shooter games, uninspired shallow phone games, and shallow-nineteenth-in-the-uninspired-franchise games does mean the rep still has some merit. 
But not much. 
Rather, the medium has just grown and matured, and has come to exemplify the ever relevant truth of [Sturgeon's_law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon's_law). 
But there is still that 10% of Sturgeon's law, and some in that 10% that are inarguably ambitious works of art and that compelled me to write this whole thing up.

Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy the occasional big-budget-little-more-than-dopamine-drip AAA game, and I still truly love some profoundly well made literal-game video games. 
But the games that occupy my memories and thoughts the most are those ambitious ones; 
those with a strong focus on narrative and thematic depth, with experimental ideas that explore the potential of interactive art, with beauty and elegance of the sort that define how exciting art can be.
So as with my [previous little write-up on my favorite 'artistic' works of a whole artistic medium](/writing/movie-recommendations-for-the-aspiring-eclectic-intellectual/), I now feel compelled to meander about my memories and thoughts of these games and solidify them in text for whoether cares to read it.

A natural place to start is where I started.

anyway, gone home is still like a million times better than yet another game about dudes shooting other dudes in the face.
