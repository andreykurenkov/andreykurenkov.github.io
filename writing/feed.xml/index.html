&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/14/us/politics/coronavirus-economy-recession-depression.html&quot;&gt;I.M.F. Predicts Worst Downturn Since the Great Depression&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/19/coronavirus-pandemic-billioinaires-racial-wealth-gap&quot;&gt;Coronavirus has widened America’s vast racial wealth gap, study finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/covid-19-coronavirus-economy-recession-stock-market/2020/6/1/21276909/george-floyd-police-coronavirus-crisis-minnesota-unemployment-protests&quot;&gt;George Floyd and the cascade of crises in black America&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the world we live in now – one in which those worst off are hit hardest by the Coronavirus, and the inequalities and ugly divides within the United States get even worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked myself what I should do about this, as someone who at least has a stable income and considerable savings from the 2 years I worked as a software engineer in the Bay Area. The answer was simple: donate a lot of the money I had saved, and do it now, ideally in a way that got it to those likeliest to get hit hardest by the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, I donated 20% of my cash savings, $7000, to GiveDirectly’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.givedirectly.org/covid-19/us/&quot;&gt;Project 100&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freshebt.com/blog/give-directly-cash-transfers/&quot;&gt;simply&lt;/a&gt; “gives $1000 cash transfers, no strings attached, to families in financial need to help make ends meet during the coronavirus crisis.” I also donated smaller amounts to other causes, but 20% was the big one. I decided on this amount as something sensible to still leave me with significant savings in case of a crisis or need (I might actually want to buy a car some day, who knows).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I share this not to elicit praise or pat myself on the back, but rather to suggest you consider doing something similar, if you are in a similar position of having considerable amounts of money saved up in checkings or savings accounts. Now more than ever it made sense to just do something big, to really give away what I could, in the face of this enormous crisis that will only make the lives of those who already have a much harder life that I do that much harder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To really address these issues would require far more than individual actions, of course. But personally, it just seemed to make sense to still do what I could, and I only hope this post might give some others in a similar position this idea to consider.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I used to be completely mystified by the appeal of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and indeed actively disliked the idea of being active on it. 
Yet in the last few years, I’ve become quite fond of it as a platform:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;figure__main&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/writing/images/2020-05-11-twitter-tips/usage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;postimageactual&quot; src=&quot;/writing/images/2020-05-11-twitter-tips/usage.png&quot; alt=&quot;Usage&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is meant for anyone who is likewise mystified, or for anyone getting started and trying to figure out the best way to use it. 
I’ll first lay out what I (as someone who is fond of the platform) see as the appeal of Twitter, and then how I try to go about using it to get the most out of it (as someone who has laid out some rules of thumb for myself based on my experience using it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of writing already exists that does this, but much of it is quite formal and focuses on stuff like ‘networking’ and ‘professional advancement’; this won’t be that serious and will instead just present my personal perspective, often with embedded tweets to serve as examples. I won’t get into the mechanics of signing up or tweeting conventions too much, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@jinjizhang/rookies-guide-to-twitter-tips-tricks-on-getting-started-getting-the-most-out-of-your-feed-7f604aa354c7&quot;&gt;there&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-setup-twitter-search-hashtag-and-login-help/&quot;&gt;are&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007513&quot;&gt;plenty&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://iaphs.org/tweet-not-tweet-twitter-academics/&quot;&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; write ups for that.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-you-can-get-out-of-twitter&quot;&gt;What you can get out of twitter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;news&quot;&gt;News&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, Twitter is a means to be ‘plugged in’. Whether its news regarding your profession, your hobbies, or any other topic, chances are if you get on Twitter and follow the right people it’ll quickly become a means of keeping up with what’s going on. Of course, it’s also a source of misinformation, but as long as you stay &lt;a href=&quot;https://abcnews.go.com/US/ways-spot-disinformation-social-media-feeds/story?id=67784438&quot;&gt;duly critical&lt;/a&gt; Twitter can legitimately make you more informed about stuff you care about and current events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;🤯😯&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple idea with amazing looking results! Always exciting to see. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/jZPjaqLoUD&quot;&gt;https://t.co/jZPjaqLoUD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Andrey Kurenkov 🤖 (@andrey_kurenkov) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/andrey_kurenkov/status/1255363161210920960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 29, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an academic whose field (Artificial Intelligence) is pretty active on Twitter, I was surprised to find how effective it was for surfacing exciting new papers, announcements about conferences, and other such relevant and useful information. Not only that, but it has often led me to encounter papers I would have likely just not seen otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Super cool way to convey research in an accessible way! Bravo 👏 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/WL1zkBPUoK&quot;&gt;https://t.co/WL1zkBPUoK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Andrey Kurenkov 🤖 (@andrey_kurenkov) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/andrey_kurenkov/status/1249904200458178560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 14, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;visibility&quot;&gt;Visibility&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the flip side of the above is that by tweeting you can try and let the world know of your own news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;When looking at RL training, it&amp;#39;s often frustrating to see the agent taking so long to discover simple things you could code up yourself for parts of the task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well now you can!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out our new work on RL with an Ensemble of Suboptimal Teachers, to be presented at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/CoRL2019?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#CoRL2019&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/CWV3VY7iID&quot;&gt;https://t.co/CWV3VY7iID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Andrey Kurenkov 🤖 (@andrey_kurenkov) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/andrey_kurenkov/status/1172333254046650369?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 13, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to engage with the site much to do this, and in fact many professors seem to be on the site primarily to share their lab’s work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Want to have your robot cut tofu or scoop icing? Our work on assistive feeding combines low-dimensional latent actions with shared autonomy for precise assistive teleoperation. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/RSS2020?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#RSS2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;paper: &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/UIpUGJPQeQ&quot;&gt;https://t.co/UIpUGJPQeQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;video: &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/fsqzB6ha1p&quot;&gt;https://t.co/fsqzB6ha1p&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;w/ Hong Jun Jeon, Dylan Losey&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Dorsa Sadigh (@DorsaSadigh) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DorsaSadigh/status/1258556202830553088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May 8, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;entertainment&quot;&gt;Entertainment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, Twitter is not all work and no play. Like much of the internet, memes and cute videos circulate on it non stop which Twitter presents to you via its mysterious algorithm for choosing the content to surface. Personally I do quite enjoy the element of randomness in my browsing, but you also have the option to limit what you see to just being a chronological view of what people you follow post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Far too relatable 😅 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/8y8mDSfgzn&quot;&gt;https://t.co/8y8mDSfgzn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Andrey Kurenkov 🤖 (@andrey_kurenkov) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/andrey_kurenkov/status/1248729851978113024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 10, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;In case you need some more weird amusing Twitter accounts to follow... here you go! This one is great :D &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/vz9fj8faIV&quot;&gt;https://t.co/vz9fj8faIV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Andrey Kurenkov 🤖 (@andrey_kurenkov) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/andrey_kurenkov/status/1257859826001907714?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May 6, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conversations&quot;&gt;Conversations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter can often be a place to air one’s thoughts, and as a result can also be a place to discuss such thoughts. Of course you can’t exactly have deeply nuanced and rich conversations, but I’ve been pleasantly surprised by the usefulness of some of the exchanges I’ve had on there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;I think generally people underestimate the capability of AI — they sort of think it&amp;#39;s a smart human ... But it&amp;#39;s going to be much more than that. It will be much smarter than the smartest human.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Present day AI is not as smart as any human, and we dont know if it ever will be.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Andrey Kurenkov 🤖 (@andrey_kurenkov) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/andrey_kurenkov/status/1167271071545876480?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;August 30, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;ah thank you, good to know the term already existed and has seen some adoption! I (and it seems others) knew of the concept but not the term, and the term itself is sensible and useful as shorthand.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Andrey Kurenkov 🤖 (@andrey_kurenkov) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/andrey_kurenkov/status/1253800196766461952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 24, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;connections&quot;&gt;Connections&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, you can legitimately get to know the body of work of people and interact with them despite having never met them. This is of course not a close connection, but it is still a potent way for getting initial connections to people in your community. These initial connections can then lead to meeting in person down the line, which is often quite fun:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;A positive aspect of Twitter (and especially &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AcademicChatter?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@AcademicChatter&lt;/a&gt; Twitter): finding out about cool people you would not otherwise have known about, keeping up with their work / views / memes, and making plans + being excited to meet in person eventually at a conference or something.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Andrey Kurenkov 🤖 (@andrey_kurenkov) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/andrey_kurenkov/status/1231419616909357057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 23, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-get-the-most-out-of-twitter&quot;&gt;How to get the most out of twitter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;do-follow-people&quot;&gt;Do: follow people&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter has a lot of quite active users, and once you find a few that post things you find cool or interesting it becomes quite fun. When I come across a cool seeming person these days I often check if they have a Twitter account to follow, and likewise follow any random people I come across on Twitter itself. Some stuff out there implies your following-follower ratio matters, but I’ve never about it myself and just follow people as I feel like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;do-be-positive-and-polite&quot;&gt;Do: Be positive and polite&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I try to be pretty positive when Tweeting. It’s ultimately a social platform, and everyone’s experience on there is a function of how everyone else uses it. There is enough negativity, cynicism, and mean-spirited criticism out there in the world, so even when having a disagreement I aim to be at least respectful to others, and generally leave my moping to myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is a rule of thumb and there are likely times in which you may share sad or negative sentiments, too. In fact, &lt;a href=&quot;https://socialbearing.com&quot;&gt;a little analysis&lt;/a&gt; shows I do so myself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;do-use-it-to-make-your-work-more-visible--accessible&quot;&gt;Do: Use it to make your work more visible &amp;amp; accessible&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-promotion can often feel lame to do, but personally I quite enjoy coming across various projects I might have never seen if not for Twitter. The enforced brevity of Twitter is actually kind of a benefit here, as it’s just a place for you to ‘elevator pitch’ it to people and share a link if they feel like reading more. This is very commonly done by AI researchers, for instance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Automatic Curriculum Learning For Deep RL: A Short Survey&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is ACL? Why use ACL? Which forms of ACL (e.g. goal generation, reward shaping, procedural gen. of envs, self-play)? What open questions?&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/2mAVUqbR0S&quot;&gt;https://t.co/2mAVUqbR0S&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;w &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RPortelas?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@RPortelas&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cedcolas?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@cedcolas&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lilianweng?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@lilianweng&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/katjahofmann?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@katjahofmann&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/to8cmc4DRM&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/to8cmc4DRM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Pierre-Yves Oudeyer (@pyoudeyer) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyoudeyer/status/1238123536004403200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 12, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Check out our work on joint semantic matching and co-segmentation in PAMI! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/oBRFHMXqGo&quot;&gt;https://t.co/oBRFHMXqGo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Code: &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/IOz8hqxj10&quot;&gt;https://t.co/IOz8hqxj10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yun-Chun will start his exciting Ph.D. journey in U of Toronto with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/animesh_garg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@animesh_garg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/JA8U9v3Bw4&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/JA8U9v3Bw4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Jia-Bin Huang (@jbhuang0604) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jbhuang0604/status/1254203605139283973?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 26, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also make a Twitter thread and share the ‘high level’ view of the work and its main take aways, which makes it much easier for people not in your immediate field to get a first feel for it and perhaps get interested. In this way Twitter is also a nice platform for science communication and engagement with non-experts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;do-feel-free-to-be-opinionated-or-silly&quot;&gt;Do: Feel free to be opinionated or silly&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, once again, all work and no play is not my policy on Twitter. It can be quite fun to share jokes or take part in memes, so if you are moved to do so I don’t think there is a big stigma about being a bit silly on there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;do-remember-that-behind-each-account-is-a-fellow-human-being-except-for-bots&quot;&gt;Do: Remember that behind each account is a fellow human being (except for bots)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good rule of thumb for everywhere on the internet, really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dont-indulge-too-much&quot;&gt;Don’t: indulge too much&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Twitter can be occasionally feel productive due to you coming upon news and such, at the end of the day it is a social media platform that is engineered to try and get you as addicted to it as possible. As with any such platform, not spending much time is a good idea. I’ve long had it on my phone and used it as my default way to fill empty time, but recently decided to uninstall it and only use it via a browser to limit my usage. I also use the time tracker RescueTime to guilt-trip myself into not wasting too much time on there or elsewhere, and would recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;figure__main&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/writing/images/2020-05-11-twitter-tips/time.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;postimageactual&quot; src=&quot;/writing/images/2020-05-11-twitter-tips/time.png&quot; alt=&quot;Usage&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dont-engage-in-needless-disagreements&quot;&gt;Don’t: Engage in needless disagreements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a corollary to the above. In a weird way, I actually think of Twitter as a useful mental excercise tool; you will likely see takes or ideas you disagree with, and i’ve found consciously choosing not to engage and instead just move on to be something i’ve gotten better at over time. The occasional discussion can be fun, of course, but more often than not this mostly a waste a time and better avoided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Agreed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not wasting your energy on dead end / unproductive conversations is essential to getting the most out of Twitter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you use it you will most likely see things you disagree with; %99 of the time, best to let it go and move on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your energy for positive exchanges :) &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/IEe4hE88gn&quot;&gt;https://t.co/IEe4hE88gn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Andrey Kurenkov 🤖 (@andrey_kurenkov) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/andrey_kurenkov/status/1248367472580767744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 9, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dont-focus-on-the-numbers&quot;&gt;Don’t: Focus on the numbers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter puts numbers (followers, favorites, retweets, etc.) in your face to an ever greater extent than other social media platforms, and even has a little personal analytics tool to track these numbers. For some professions cultivating a following is of course important and it’s not realistic to ignore these numbers, but personally I try to do just that as much as possible. In fact, I have installed a plugin called &lt;a href=&quot;https://bengrosser.com/projects/twitter-demetricator/&quot;&gt;Twitter Demetricator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;This Twitter Demetricator extension is really a game changer for this site! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So refreshing to not care how much something has been shared/liked and just to judge content (see example in img). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus encouraged me to uninstall on phone, also a good call. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/fm63zlQw3t&quot;&gt;https://t.co/fm63zlQw3t&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/V30PSyfss5&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/V30PSyfss5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Andrey Kurenkov 🤖 (@andrey_kurenkov) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/andrey_kurenkov/status/1251293638593622016?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 17, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dont-propagate-misinformation&quot;&gt;Don’t: Propagate misinformation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, you might be surprised with how easy it is to fall for false information and propagate it via likes or retweets. A good rule of thumb is to not immediately believe anything you read, until you can verify the primary source that information is based on.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2 id=&quot;foreword&quot;&gt;Foreword&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is a lot to take in, so if you choose to not read it right now, I would recommend you at least watch this 4 minute video:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/z-IR48Mb3W0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also choose to watch this video version instead of reading:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/TYWbUmSzSYU&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“In 2017, an estimated 11 million U.S. adults aged 18 or older had at least one major depressive episode with severe impairment. This number represented 4.5% of all U.S. adults. … Approximately 35% of adults with major depressive episode did not receive treatment.”&lt;br /&gt;
—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/major-depression.shtml&quot;&gt;National Institude of Mental Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Overall, male university students exhibited low overall mental health, limited mental health knowledge, weak mental health beliefs, poor mental health attitudes, high self-stigma to seek help, significant impacts of help-seeking on self-confidence, and low intention to seek professional help. “&lt;br /&gt;
—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www-tandfonline-com.stanford.idm.oclc.org/doi/full/10.1080/07448481.2018.1434780?journalCode=vach20&quot;&gt;Mental health literacy, stigma, and help-seeking behaviors among male college students&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Help starts with understanding. Though false stereotypes about people with depression&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; certainly persist, another important issue is that many people just don’t know much about it. If your knowledge about depression amounts to “it’s a mental health thing where you feel terrible, sometimes to the point of being suicidal, and there are a lot pills for it”, you are not equipped to help yourself or others when faced with this disease. And yet, based on the above statistics it’s clear that just about everyone needs to be ready to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Based on data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2007, approximately 25% of adults with mental illness believed that others are sympathetic toward patients diagnosed with these conditions.”&lt;br /&gt;
—&lt;a href=&quot;https://mhc.cpnp.org/doi/full/10.9740/mhc.2018.09.227?journalCode=mhcl&quot;&gt;Evaluation of perceptions and knowledge of mental illness in the United States through crowdsourcing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Mental health literacy seems to have a promising effect on care seeking. Individuals who better recognize their mental illness and its manifestations, as well as treatment options to address its varied impressions, might better avail themselves of those options (Jorm, 2012).”&lt;br /&gt;
—&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/stoken/rbtfl/dDpyhM2zRi.Fg/full&quot;&gt;“The Impact of Mental Illness Stigma on Seeking and Participating in Mental Health Care”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are already many resources aimed at assisting with that, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webmd.com/depression/features/people-depression-wish-you-knew#1&quot;&gt;“What People With Depression Wish You Knew”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.verywellmind.com/depression-facts-you-should-know-1067617&quot;&gt;“7 Facts You Should Know About Depression”&lt;/a&gt;, and many more. Much of their content is focused on explaning what depression &lt;strong&gt;is not&lt;/strong&gt; with statements such as “Depression Is More Than Ordinary Sadness” and “It’s a real disease”, which is commendable but also results in them not discussing many aspects of what depression &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt;. This is going to be the aim of this piece; more specifically, the intent is to make it easier for anyone to empathize and help others dealing with depression or to face it yourself&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. More concretly, I will address the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-depression&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Is Depression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/major-depression#1&quot;&gt;Clinical depression&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK64063/&quot;&gt;diagnosable health condition&lt;/a&gt; with the following diagonostic criteria&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Depressed mood and/or loss of interest or pleasure in life activities for at least 2 weeks and at least five of the following symptoms that cause clinically significant impairment in social, work, or other important areas of functioning almost every day:&lt;br /&gt;
1.Depressed mood most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;
2.Diminished interest or pleasure in all or most activities.&lt;br /&gt;
3.Significant unintentional weight loss or gain.&lt;br /&gt;
4.Insomnia or sleeping too much.&lt;br /&gt;
5.Agitation or psychomotor retardation noticed by others.&lt;br /&gt;
6.Fatigue or loss of energy.&lt;br /&gt;
7.Feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt.&lt;br /&gt;
8.Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness.&lt;br /&gt;
9.Recurrent thoughts of death (APA, 2000, p. 356).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This period of 2 or more weeks of “depressed mood and/or loss of interest or pleasure in life activities” is known as a major depressive &lt;strong&gt;episode&lt;/strong&gt;, and many people with depression experience more than one such episode in their life:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Major depressive disorder is one of the most common forms of psychopathology, one that will affect approximately one in six men and one in four women in their lifetimes (Kessler et al., 1994). It is also usually highly recurrent, with at least 50% of those who recover from a first episode of depression having one or more additional episodes in their lifetime, and approximately 80% of those with a history of two episodes having another recurrence (American Psychiatric Association, 2000; Kupfer, Frank, &amp;amp; Wamhoff, 1996; Post, 1992). Once a first episode has occurred, recurrent episodes will usually begin within five years of the initial episode (Belsher &amp;amp; Costello, 1988; Lewinsohn, Clarke, Seeley, &amp;amp; Rohde, 1994), and, on average, individuals with a history of depression will have five (Kessler &amp;amp; Walters, 1998) to nine (Kessler, Zhao, Blazer, &amp;amp; Swartz, 1997) separate depressive episodes in their lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;
—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2169519/&quot;&gt;Risk for Recurrence in Depression&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important thing to note about episodes is their length. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mydr.com.au/mental-health/depression-q-and-a&quot;&gt;Depression is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; a temporary mood&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“It is natural to temporarily feel ‘down in the dumps’ from time to time, especially if you are going through an upheaval, loss or stressful situation. Some people refer to this as ‘feeling depressed’. However, if these feelings are intense and persist over weeks or months and if they stop you enjoying or even doing your normal activities, it’s likely that you have depression. Depression is a serious illness that can have a great impact on your everyday life. It’s not something you can normally ‘just snap out of’.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, this is precisely what makes it so bad; generally, even with treatment it’ll take weeks or months to get better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-causes-depression&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Causes Depression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The science is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-depression-just-bad-chemistry/&quot;&gt;still unclear&lt;/a&gt; on the balance of genetic and environmental causes for depression, so it’s generally correct to understand that it is caused by a combination of the two. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/depression#inheritance&quot;&gt;Genetics Home Reference&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Depression is known to run in families, suggesting that genetic factors contribute to the risk of developing this disease. However, research into the genetics of depression is in its early stages, and very little is known for certain about the genetic basis of the disease. … Nongenetic (environmental) factors also play critical roles in a person’s risk of developing depression. The disorder can be triggered by substance abuse, certain medications, or stressful life events (such as divorce or the death of a loved one). … It is likely that environmental conditions interact with genetic factors to determine the overall risk of developing this disease.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is however important to note that if you have a close relative who had dealt with depression, you are more likely to experience it as well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“People who have a first-degree relative (for example, a parent or sibling) with depression appear to have a two to three times greater risk of developing the condition than the general public. However, many people who develop depression do not have a family history of the disorder, and many people with an affected relative never develop the disorder.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also the case that for some people depression is at least partially caused &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/seasonal-affective-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20364651&quot;&gt;by seasonal changes in weather, and especially lack of sun&lt;/a&gt;. Lastly, different occupations and socioeconomic conditions of course have different risk levels for depression:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Rates for clinical depression in 55 industries ranged from 6.9 to 16.2 %, (population rate = 10.45 %). Industries with the highest rates tended to be those which, on the national level, require frequent or difficult interactions with the public or clients, and have high levels of stress and low levels of physical activity.”&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our results show that graduate students are more than six times as likely to experience depression and anxiety as compared to the general population … 39% of graduate students scored in the moderate to severe depression range in our study, as compared to 6% of the general population measured previously with the same scale “&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-it-like-to-have-depression&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Is It Like To Have Depression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above definitions are somewhat formal, and I suspect do not help very much with understanding what a person dealing with it is going through. Speaking less formally, there are at least three parts of the subjective experience of depression one needs to understand:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Emotional: Your baseline enjoyment of life decreases. In other words, you start constantly feeling a sense of suffering, or emotional pain, for no clear reason. Your are more negatively impacted by set-backs, and find it harder to enjoy the things that bring you pleasure and joy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Physical&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;: You have less energy. Just about anything feels like a tiresome undertaking, and you often feel like just lying down and doing nothing. It may &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-bipolar-lens/201503/when-your-mind-wont-let-your-body-move&quot;&gt;seem impossible to do the smallest of tasks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:spoons&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:spoons&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mental: Your thinking becomes distorted and negative. Your self esteem decreases, so that you feel worthless. Thinking and concentraing becomes harder, as if trying to see something through a fog. It’s hard to imagine things becoming better, or to form a positive idea of the future in general. You have a variety of &lt;a href=&quot;https://adaa.org/learn-from-us/from-the-experts/blog-posts/consumer/unwanted-intrusive-thoughts&quot;&gt;intrusive negative thoughts&lt;/a&gt;, which at the worst often deal with self harm of even suicide; these thoughts can happen regardless of however much you believe or agree with their content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is still somewhat abstract and hard to empathize with, so to further understand this condition I recommend listening to this song:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/yUnIU8RMawo&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as you can imagine it’s a difficult and highly painful condition to be in. The above is what you really need to understand, though &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.andreykurenkov.com/writing/life/conveying-depression/&quot;&gt;it only starts to describe it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-can-you-know-you-have-depression&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Can You Know You Have Depression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the tricky aspects of depression is that the above stated symptoms can often happen to varying degress as part of normal life, without reflecting a mental health condition. So how do you know whether you are going through a rough patch, or are dealing with depression?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The obvious answer is that you should consult a mental health professional, if you think depression is a possibility. But that’s also not an easy thing to do. So, an easy alternative is to start with a a &lt;a href=&quot;https://psychcentral.com/quizzes/depression-quiz/&quot;&gt;short multiple choice quiz&lt;/a&gt;, which can inform you on whether it is time to seek professional help. There are also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthline.com/health/depression/top-iphone-android-apps#talklife&quot;&gt;many apps&lt;/a&gt; that serve a similar purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-to-do-if-you-think-you-have-depression&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What To Do If You Think You Have Depression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are my &lt;strong&gt;personal and subjective&lt;/strong&gt; recommendations on things to keep in mind and do if you think you may be dealing with depression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, try to understand that however bad things may seem, your perception of how bad things are is distorted by this condition, and objectively things are probably not as bad as they seem. One thing I found helpful was to think of there being two of me - the “depressed Andrey” and the “healthy Andrey”, with the former thinking quite unlike the latter; it was important to remember that what I considered my true self, with the beliefs I agreed with, was the healthy Andrey. Keeping that in mind may not make you feel better, but it’ll make it easier to motivate yourself to take the following steps to get better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, do your best to continue living your life as before. Keep waking up, showering, going outside, seeing friends, excercising, etc (to the extent that you can; do not feel guilty about things you cannot do). The more you keep moving, keep believing if you put in the work things will get better, the less painful it will all be. It may not be easy, but the important thing is to not give up, and to keep making the effort. One thing that helped me is an unwavering belief in “this too shall pass”; if you truly believe the above facts about depression, you should also believe that it &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt; pass with treatment, so it’s only a matter of time and perseverance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, try to reach out for help. First and foremost, try and confide in your close friends and family, who can help you in this difficulty time. If it is an option, a therapist, or at least a support group, is an ideal first option to help you cope with this. Depending on their recommendation, you may also want to see a psychiatrist and consider taking antidepressants. Although you may be uncomfortable with this course of action, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dbsalliance.org/site/PageServer?pagename=education_statistics_depression&quot;&gt;you really ought to go through with it&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Up to 80% of those treated for depression show an improvement in their symptoms generally within four to six weeks of beginning medication, psychotherapy, attending support groups or a combination of these treatments. (National Institute of Health, 1998). Despite its high treatment success rate, nearly two out of three people suffering with depression do not actively seek nor receive proper treatment. (DBSA, 1996)”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, if there are external/environmental causes for your depression, do your best to remove them. For instance, if you are stressed by work, try and put it on pause. This too is likely not easy, but if it is doable it is definitely beneficial. At the very least, it’s a good idea to have things to look forward to, such as a vacation or a trip to be with family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifth, if things are getting really bad and seem to just be getting worse, be cautious with making life altering decisions at this time. As described above, your thinking and by extension your decision making becomes distorted and therefore unreliable. I personally almost called off applying for PhD programs while depressed, and am very glad in hindsight that I did not. One thing that helps is to try and remember this notion of the “healthy you”, and what that version of you would think of this course of action. Consulting with others is a great idea, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, this especially applies to any thoughts of self harm; if things are getting to the point of getting concerning, try and make ahead of time what you’ll do when in a really tough place to survive it, such as calling the &lt;a href=&quot;https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/&quot;&gt;National Suicide Prevention Lifeline&lt;/a&gt;. One thing I found helpful was to just promise to myself that no matter how things got, no matter how many thoughts about it I had, I would not really consider or attempt suicide; to be honest, you may think about it a lot, but knowing that these are just thoughts and you don’t truly consider that an option makes them more bearable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;are-antidepressants-necessary-to-heal-depression&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are Antidepressants Necessary to Heal Depression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to feel uncomfortable about the idea of antidepressants, but the fact is that they are often an effective treatment for depression:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The various antidepressants have been compared in many studies. Overall, the commonly used tricyclic antidepressants SSRIs and SSNRIs performed equally well. Studies of adults with moderate or severe depression showed:&lt;br /&gt;
Without antidepressants: About 20 to 40 out of 100 people who took a placebo noticed an improvement in their symptoms within six to eight weeks.&lt;br /&gt;
With antidepressants: About 40 to 60 out of 100 people who took an antidepressant noticed an improvement in their symptoms within six to eight weeks.”&lt;br /&gt;
—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK361016/&quot;&gt;Depression: How effective are antidepressants?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“All antidepressants were more efficacious than placebo in adults with major depressive disorder. … Our literature search was as comprehensive as possible, including the largest amount of unpublished data to date, which are associated with less favourable effect sizes for antidepressants.”&lt;br /&gt;
—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32802-7/fulltext&quot;&gt;Comparative efficacy and acceptability of 21 antidepressant drugs for the acute treatment of adults with major depressive disorder: a systematic review and network meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webmd.com/depression/features/are-antidepressants-effective#1&quot;&gt;they are not the solution for everyone&lt;/a&gt;: “But a report recently published in The Journal of the American Medical Association showed that the drugs work best for very severe cases of depression and have little or no benefit over placebo (inactive pills) in less serious cases.”  Certainly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodtherapy.org/blog/can-depression-be-cured-without-medication-1117144&quot;&gt;mild to moderate depression can be healed without medication&lt;/a&gt;, and in fact that has worked for me in the past, but in a severe case such as mine it should really be considered. This is really a case where talking to a therapist or psychiatrist is ideal, to understand your needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2719451/&quot;&gt;Antidepressants do have side effects&lt;/a&gt;, and some people struggle with finding the right medication for them. In my case, my psychiatrist asked me to ask my relatives what worked for them, and that indeed proved very effective for me (after months of excercise, therapy, talking to friends, and other measures did not improve my condition). So to conclude, while they are not necessary, antidepressants are an important option that should be considered with the consultation of a mental health professional for serious cases of depression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Antidepressants are not meant to make you happy (they are not ‘happy pills’), so much as to heal you of depression and just make you normal. In my case, I did have a brief period of time after starting on them in which I was unusually cheerful and energetic, but this soon subsided and I just started to feel like my regular self. One thing to know is that you will need to continue taking them for some time after your depression improves, and it may take a process of gradual reduction to be able to stop. In my case this slight lack of freedom has certainly been worth it, but it is something you should be aware of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-help-someone-who-has-depression&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How To Help Someone Who Has Depression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is tough, but boils down to the same one always needs to do to help someone: have compassion, care for them, and just be there. Beyond that, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthline.com/health/how-to-help-a-depressed-friend#take-care-of-yourself&quot;&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.helpguide.org/articles/depression/helping-someone-with-depression.htm&quot;&gt;lists&lt;/a&gt; out there provide good further recommendations. One thing I will personally emphasize is that you should try and be direct about asking if someone is doing well. If they seem to be having many of the symptoms of depression, don’t hesitate to follow up a simple “how are you doing lately” with “are you sure things are alright? it’s just that you seem more down than usual lately”, or the like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feedback&lt;/strong&gt;
If you think there are other essential bits of information I should add to this, or have other feedback, feel free to reach out to me at my email andreyvkurenkov at gmail dot com .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;When I write “depression” in this post I refer to major depressive disorder, also known as clinical depression &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I will do this through a mix of summarizing what is objectively known about depression and sharing my own personal experience with it. Disclaimer: I am not a mental health professional or doctor, and write this only as someone who has dealt with depression and educated myself about it. What I share about my own experience will of course not be universal, but will still hopefully be helpful. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:4&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, which has historically had some flaws, but in this case provides a sensible definition. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:4&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:5&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;These are of course partially mental, so I mean physical here in the sense of dealing with physical movement or sensing. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:5&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:spoons&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is sometimes conveyed with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory&quot;&gt;spoon metaphor&lt;/a&gt;, which involves imagining us all as having a limited discrete quantity of ‘energy units’ every day, which one can think of as spoons, and understanding that those with mental illness have fewer of these each day and so can do less. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:spoons&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/writing/images/2020-02-16-lessons-learned-from-failures/failures.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;postimageactual&quot; src=&quot;/writing/images/2020-02-16-lessons-learned-from-failures/failures.png&quot; alt=&quot;Timeline&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Success is the ability to go from failure to failure without losing your enthusiasm.” —Winston Churchill&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Failure is only the opportunity to begin again, only this time more wisely.” —Henry Ford&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“If we knew what we were doing, we wouldn’t call it research.” —Albert Einstein&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;why-i-wrote-this&quot;&gt;Why I Wrote This&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Struggle, failure, and sometimes feeling out of your depth are all inherently part of the PhD experience. These are often also accompanied by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ascb.org/careers/frauds-managing-imposter-syndrome-grad-school/&quot;&gt;impostor syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, or the feeling of being inferior to those around you and a ‘fraud’. Something I find odd is that the existence of impostor syndrome is common knowledge by now, and yet just knowing of it is not enough to avoid succumbing to it. Likewise, knowing that facing failure is a universal trait of succesful people (as indicated by the quotes above) does not automatically make doing so yourself easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, with a few years of grad school and many failures now behind me, I decided it would be nice to try and help some of my fellow students with these things. But given reiterating things we already know seems ineffective, I decided to take a different tact: just put my record of failures out there, so others facing similar struggles can objectively know they are at least no more an impostor than I am. And so I did, with the following video:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/uxYpJ5mMKx0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This post is an addendum to that, summarizing the main non-obvious lessons I took away from these failures. You can either read the below text, or watch this follow up video in which I convey what is written in the text, or both:
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/YQC74cSgM1Q&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-lessons&quot;&gt;The Lessons&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;test-your-ideas-as-quickly-and-simply-as-possible&quot;&gt;1. Test your ideas as quickly and simply as possible&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research involves a lot of debugging and trying to pinpoint why things are working (is your code buggy, or is the idea itself wrong). One  easy to agree with but hard to internalize practice is to construct contrived scenarios in which you know your idea should work, so that you can ensure the code is not a problem. In other words, construct &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanity_check&quot;&gt;sanity checks&lt;/a&gt;, such as for instance if you are working on object recognition, start with a synthetic dataset of simple geometric shapes that simply has to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With my first project at Stanford, I did not realize to do this until after testing my code on the real task, and starting with the sanity check instead might have saved a good deal of time. This has been an essential go-to practice for me in every project since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;margin:auto;&quot;&gt;Neat thing from a while back: visualization of an RL agent&amp;#39;s policy globally (in many states) while doing rollout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would be cool to see more like it, since shows if the agent is optimal or not and how much it generalized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should be fairly doable in Atari or 3D robotics envs... &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/sD70b6ydJJ&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/sD70b6ydJJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Andrey Kurenkov 🤖 (@andrey_kurenkov) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/andrey_kurenkov/status/1227099590131716098?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 11, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;persevere-but-also-pivot&quot;&gt;2. Persevere, but also pivot&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the basic frustrating things with research is that perseverance is essential, but so is recognizing that something is not going to work and rethinking your approach. So, which should you do when you idea is not working, persevere or pivot? Both – persevere for a while, try to see more clearly why things are not working and whether they might work, and move on if they don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But moving on need not result in losing all the wrong you’ve just done. Hopefully, you had good reason to believe your idea was good in the first place, and it not working can yield a different but related direction to explore. This was the case for me with my second scrapped project; the next major research project I did was directly inspired from the struggles of that scrapped project. Likewise, the project I am currently focused on acquired its focus only after months of things not working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, keep an eye out for the insights to be found in failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;focus-on-one-or-two-big-things-at-a-time&quot;&gt;3. Focus on one or two big things at a time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my weaknesses as a grad student is a tendency to want to multi task and take on many side projects (as evidenced by the above youtube video and the text you are reading now). Some amount of exploration and side projects are of course not bad – personally I think more AI researchers should engage in science communication – but it’s easy to overdo it. In particular, at least as a junior PhD student having more than two research projects going at a time (importantly, with one in the implementation phase and one more in the ideation phase) is a good recipe for at least one of those projects dying off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A related notion is ‘ideas are cheap, execution is everything’. That is to say, ideas are not worth much without execution to hone and actuate them (of course, advisors not directly writing code but suggesting ideas and being in the loop of execution is still invaluable). This is important to remember when you have a cool new idea and are tempted to get efforts on it going despite already having some projects in flight; if you don’t have the bandwidth to execute the idea the best thing is to wait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Legitimately one of the best insights I&amp;#39;ve internalized after years of doing research is the old classic - &amp;quot;ideas are cheap, execution is everything&amp;quot; [not quite everything, we still need cool ideas, but y&amp;#39;know] &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/9JK5tDhCKw&quot;&gt;https://t.co/9JK5tDhCKw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Andrey Kurenkov 🤖 (@andrey_kurenkov) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/andrey_kurenkov/status/1222930287111233536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;January 30, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My suggestion to people who like side projects and multi tasking, like me: learn and embrace patience. The ideas that really excite will stick with you, and if you are patient there will come a time when it is strategically smart to go ahead and execute them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;find-a-good-team-and-be-a-good-team-player&quot;&gt;4. Find a good team, and be a good team player&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I intentionally avoided focusing on my successes in grad school in the above video, but thankfully I have had a few of those too. And every time I have succeeded, it was because I had great mentors and fellow PhD students working with me on whatever we were doing, and the success was really not my own but the team’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, such a team dynamic does not necessarily come about by itself; research can sometimes be a lonely endeavour, with you toiling away primarily by yourself with occasional feedback. For a largely applied discipline with a lot of implementation effort (such as AI), I really don’t think working in such a mode is ideal. So, if you do find yourself in such a spot, proactively trying to find people to work with might be a good idea. Personally, I’ve found working with both post-docs (who can be more hands-on than most advisors) and one or two fellow grad students (who can get their hands dirty alongside you) to be very helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even if you find people to work with, that does not mean things will be easier automatically. Effective teamwork is a tricky thing (so much so that I wrote up &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.andreykurenkov.com/writing/project/effective-teamwork/&quot;&gt;a little summary&lt;/a&gt; of the main things to do and not do), and it’s up to you to be mindful of how things are in terms of team dynamics. For the last few times that I put significant amounts of work into efforts that were in the end scrapped, I would say the main cause was me going at it too much by myself and not getting enough of a team consensus around one direction. So, remember to not be too much of a lone wolf and to be an effective communicator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;maintain-your-health&quot;&gt;5. Maintain Your Health&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter how much of a tough skin you have, research is not meant to be easy and sometimes things will get tough. Unfortunately, in grad school it’s all too easy to let yourself completely give up on work-life balance at such times and go full on tunnel vision mode. Sometimes going all in on research leading up to a deadline is not a bad idea, but you have to be cognizant of whether you have enough physical and emotional energy for it and at all costs avoid burn out. And the fact is, burn out, anxiety, and even depression are things you may have to face at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it is all the more important to practice and get good at relaxing (weird as that may sound). Seriously, knowing yourself well enough to have good healthy ways of dealing with stress is &lt;strong&gt;essential&lt;/strong&gt; and often not praised enough. Personally, when I was dealing with clinical depression I leaned on a whole set of activities that kept me going: reading on my porch most evenings, watching a ton of fun anime, going to kickboxing classes, cooking, and where I was really down playing some really absorbing video games (Civ 5, I’m looking at you).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days I am really big on napping, but i’m also a big believer in &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/7QyObECIZAE&quot;&gt;meditation&lt;/a&gt; and of course the benefits of excercise and a good support network cannot be overstated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there you have it, my main lessons gathered so far. This is not all the advice I think is useful for taking on grad school, but it is the advice I had to learn the hard way and that I think is at least somewhat interesting. Feel free to comment with your own thoughts on this topic!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;AI Salon is a roughly bi-weekly event on Fridays where the AI Lab gathers to discuss high-level topics in AI and machine learning. The goal is to encourage ourselves to think beyond our individual day-to-day research, and better see how our work fits into the long-term trajectory of scientific progress, and into society as a whole. Each Salon has a different topic for discussion, which is led by two speakers: typically one expert guest, and one AI Lab member. We hold the event in the spirit of Enlightenment-era salons, with no electronics or whiteboard allowed: only free-ranging discussion among attendees, starting with a 10-minute opening statement from the two speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In this paper, we formalize Mechanical Search and study a version where distractor objects are heaped over the target object in a bin. The robot uses an RGBD perception system and control policies to iteratively select, parameterize, and perform one of 3 actions – push, suction, grasp – until the target object is extracted, or either a time limit is exceeded, or no high confidence push or grasp is available. We present a study of 5 algorithmic policies for mechanical search, with 15,000 simulated trials and 300 physical trials for heaps ranging from 10 to 20 objects. Results suggest that success can be achieved in this long-horizon task with algorithmic policies in over 95% of instances and that the number of actions required scales approximately linearly with the size of the heap.&lt;/p&gt;
