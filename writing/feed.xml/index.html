    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Revised from an email I wrote to a friend some years ago.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should warn you this will get overlong. In my 10 or so years of watching Good movies I have come across many that have imprinted themselves onto my memory - hovering images and sounds that in a curious way make me happy to be alive. What I will now do is try to put all those most striking experiences into a flowing set of paragraphs and hope it all coheres. Perhaps these shall have the same effect for you, perhaps not - nonetheless let’s go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any conversation with me about quality art movies has got to start with Andrei Tarkovsky, the poetically melancholic depths of any Russian’s soul incarnate. Very slow. Very poetic. Beautiful, disturbing, strange, spiritual. An acquired taste, and to some a complete nonsensical bore. &lt;strong&gt;Solaris&lt;/strong&gt;, a trippy 3-hour sci fi meditation on love and human consciousness, is a good starting point as the most accessible of his films. But I prefer his latter yet more poetically inclined works, such as &lt;strong&gt;The Sacrifice&lt;/strong&gt; - a tale of a man averting a nuclear war through a spiritual journey. Better yet is &lt;strong&gt;Stalker&lt;/strong&gt;, a 3-hour meditation on faith and the struggles inside our souls, and one of my favorite films. These movies have characters and stories, but describing them is almost beside the point - Tarkovsky’s work is visual poetry, and can only really be understood as such.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;postimage&quot; src=&quot;https://draftin.com:443/images/33122?token=7iV9cR_SsFlaUhBUMaA1ig5xTuE344ic99SQ6ElGChkr7zx7bvDTIKyVNc0qro4_AncYv-VBGF6f5oi-24n4yKQ&quot; alt=&quot;Stalker&quot; /&gt;     
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, Andrei Zvyagintsev, the recent successor to Tarkovsky’s crown - a sort of enlightened monarch who retains many of the customs but changes the underlying frame of mind. I will without reserve recommend three of his films: &lt;strong&gt;The Return&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Elena&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Leviathan&lt;/strong&gt;. The first is his first movie, and is as difficult as it is rewarding to watch, the sort of movie that sinks into you, the sort of movie that you have not seen before, the sort of movie that when you realize its subtle story you experience a moment of wonder and appreciation for its elegance. Or, the sort of movie you call pretentious and stop watching midway through, much as with Tarkovsky. &lt;strong&gt;Elena&lt;/strong&gt; is both more and less complicated, a stylish slow neo-noir that many critics amazingly did not comprehend to be a devastating critique of modern Russian society as well as its history. Luckily critics had no such difficulty with &lt;strong&gt;Leviathan&lt;/strong&gt;, a transparent and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oo7H25kirk&quot;&gt;devastatingly beautiful&lt;/a&gt; critique of the corruption of modem Russian government and spirituality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;postimage&quot; src=&quot;https://draftin.com:443/images/33164?token=g5dWtasZaV7cc9NwSJ2RyPSJU_79js7SZk9Lr1Wi-U9V5JK8reBPidTzQwwdiHU6XfY61OV3ggPcFRMmh9n0S_k&quot; alt=&quot;Leviathan&quot; /&gt;     
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another quite good slow Russian movie is &lt;strong&gt;The Island&lt;/strong&gt;, but lets not get fixated on those. After Tarkovsky, my first GOTO masterclass director has got to be Ingmar Bergman, the director to top every director’s list of favorite directors (or at least Woody Allen’s… and Tarkovsky’s… and Kubrick’s…). His movies are about… many things, the subconscious depths and murks of our half-understood psyches most of all perhaps. Slow, quiet, amazingly talented at creating minimalist black and white scenes. &lt;strong&gt;The Seventh Seal&lt;/strong&gt;, a classic film about a medieval knight who plays chess with Death, is a good starting point. &lt;strong&gt;The Hour of the Wolf&lt;/strong&gt;, a sort of slowly creeping surreal film about guilt, derangement, and ultimately horror is at the other end of the spectrum of accessibility but is supremely good. And this more or less is the range of Bergman’s large body of work - dark explorations of human’s shattered souls and psyches rendered with unbelievably striking black and white imagery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;postimage&quot; src=&quot;https://draftin.com:443/images/33166?token=Sq9TWbrnPcO9MCegAOWl9YM92HCe3FreRsHn26-Kfye7NFswz6vPCESgkjvH8sUZI5E-gytfNHgAKacWDDsseMc&quot; alt=&quot;The Seventh Seal&quot; /&gt;     
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But all this is so recent, pretty much 60s onwards, what kind of self-respecting movie person would I be if I dont have some directors from the olden days to show some love for? A bad one, clearly. That’s where Friz Lang, the mad genius from the days when sound has yet to ground cinema to dull reality, enters the picture. Have I seen any of his crazy epics besides Metropolis? No, but I can tell you &lt;strong&gt;Metropolis&lt;/strong&gt; is quite the crazy epic and perhaps the first sci-fi film (robots!). It’s hard to beat &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ebertfest.com/thirteen/metropolis.html&quot;&gt;Ebert&lt;/a&gt; on this one: “Lang’s film is the summit of German Expressionism, with its combination of stylized sets, dramatic camera angles, bold shadows and frankly artificial theatrics.” But! Believe it or not, the much less grand &lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt; - a film about the merciless retribution of a city against one who has sinned against it - may be the better film. Either way, you can’t go wrong with Lang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;postimage&quot; src=&quot;https://draftin.com:443/images/33168?token=dIfqMhRME5us-_B68taUPNXJZyUeNyvRsztjl9AeLOOZx5-2WNIpKO_NMNL3X8jqJ9WuIhOgMHH4YD0g-U7h3lI&quot; alt=&quot;Metropolis&quot; /&gt;     
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then ofcourse there’s the other director any person who has taken a film history class is overjoyed to bring up in normal conversation (because damn it, the world needs to know your knowledge), Sergei Eisenstein. But &lt;strong&gt;Battleship Potempkin&lt;/strong&gt; really is quite Radical, the prototypical example of the alternative form of cinema that bloomed in the strange days of soviet youth. If you want to get truly crazy, give Vertov’s &lt;strong&gt;Man with a Movie Camera&lt;/strong&gt; a watch - its not just capital R Radical, its all-caps RADICAL, but in the sort of intellectually and theoretically backed way that is actually quite striking and at least it makes sense maybe and does not seem like a student project by a guy who has seen too many artsy short films.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;postimage&quot; src=&quot;https://draftin.com:443/images/33169?token=6AMiChfeW2UxJZdhflEGkD8uf7FiqEOJM5NT6eBjpiAFNzYkYGNflo6yf3QD-EulMU-3S-s5QXa6rLK9sf4niOs&quot; alt=&quot;Man With A Movie Camera&quot; /&gt;     
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the pond Chaplin and Keaton are making far less weird masterpieces about this time (&lt;strong&gt;Modern Times&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt;The General&lt;/strong&gt;), but let’s stick with European strangeness, specifically that hailing from Spain. Here Luis Bunuel has managed to hang out with Dali a bit too long and accidentally produces &lt;strong&gt;Un Chien Andalou&lt;/strong&gt;, a surreal movie to surmount all surreal movies. This does seem like a student project by a guy who has seen too many artsy short films, but hey, it was the first, and its got some hella weird imagery. Bunuel then continues to make weird surreal cinema for decades, eventually getting around to laugh-out-loud family favorites such as &lt;strong&gt;The Discrete Charm of the Bourgeoisie&lt;/strong&gt;. Basically, if you are in the mood for surrealism, then this guy can hook you up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;postimage&quot; src=&quot;https://draftin.com:443/images/33171?token=XcSoMc2F9qs09dcuN08Q6edZsHiKgcXTml2mJCDsFz5OCvNdgn3LC-kJjzYlOrd3uBeBgmBQN-I5Muy0hyC2UIA&quot; alt=&quot;Un Chien Andalou&quot; /&gt;     
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As fun as Bunuel’s surrealism can be, sometimes you just want to stick to the weight and tragedies of the real world. Well then, fine, just go be morose in the reality of post WWII Italy. Yes indeed, Italian Neorealism is where its at. &lt;strong&gt;Umberto D&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Bicycle Thieves&lt;/strong&gt; are the ones that I know should be seen, and I cant help but squeeze in a mention of &lt;strong&gt;Ikiru&lt;/strong&gt; by Kurosawa here as well (ah, but you must see Kurosawa! Too many of his movies deserve mention, at the very least the grand truth-mocking treatise that is &lt;strong&gt;Rashomon&lt;/strong&gt;). Still, there is only so much hard real-world reality you can take - luckily Fellini’s comes in later and slowly merges Italian Neorialism with very personal surrealism. Another person more of whose movies I should watch, but at least I can say &lt;strong&gt;8 1/2&lt;/strong&gt; is wholly enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;postimage&quot; src=&quot;https://draftin.com:443/images/33185?token=PIkh2isQSk6RP6MWHBkPmRKOXn6J1WcBu-ZOq4QSSupEhJKjTN9MND9uHsWSHAJQ4t7t_TrNpLcd6pHGUsDWMME&quot; alt=&quot;Bycicle Thieves&quot; /&gt;     
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But lets say you want your surrealism with a dose of psychoanalysis and strangely menacing Americana. Two words: David Lynch. Let’s get this out of the way: Lynch’s hair is amazing. Did he start my appreciation for nonconformal hair? It’s possible. &lt;strong&gt;Eraserhead&lt;/strong&gt;, his incredibly weird movie about city and family oppression and fear in the mind of a young artist featuring a weird worm baby and an actual eraserhead, is also notable for crazy hair. But for real, &lt;strong&gt;Mulholland Drive&lt;/strong&gt; is another one of my favorite movies - a story that makes perfect sense in dream logic, the true realization of the promise of surrealism in cinema, a modern film so vivid with color and character your eyes feel drunk. Its predecessor, &lt;strong&gt;Lost Highway&lt;/strong&gt;, is also in that vein and also has Nick Cage, so it’s pretty much a must see. But if the vivid color and subversion of quintessentially American naivette is more exciting to you than Nick Cage, then &lt;strong&gt;Blue Velvet&lt;/strong&gt; is definitely where you will get the most thrills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;postimage&quot; src=&quot;https://draftin.com:443/images/33186?token=o0Ce8LgS7xqEflwfFfe_LidlB6nTT8qIUwMiWhDi5374dGpr3mgCEpU5Wisn42j77S4b15rLrTYEmnB4D8BjH8E&quot; alt=&quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; /&gt;     
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of America, it turns out some fine directors lived there. Too many I am aware of, in fact. So let’s get some famous ones out of the way: Kubrick (&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Strangelove&lt;/strong&gt;), Francis Ford Copolla (&lt;strong&gt;Apocalypse Now&lt;/strong&gt;), Scorsese (&lt;strong&gt;Taxi Driver&lt;/strong&gt;), Allen (&lt;strong&gt;Annie Hall&lt;/strong&gt;), the Coens (&lt;strong&gt;Fargo&lt;/strong&gt;), Fincher (&lt;strong&gt;Fight Club&lt;/strong&gt;). Yeah, I know, you’re not impressed. Let’s move on to the hip ones. Darren Aronofsky, a fairly recent addition to the cannon of distinguished American filmmakers. His first movie was the low-budget &lt;strong&gt;Pi&lt;/strong&gt;, a film about a gifted mathematician increasingly going insane in search of the deep fundamental mathematical truth. That’s Aronofsky in a nutshell - people struggling and increasingly coming apart, as shown with unsubtle but very potent vision. In the magnificent &lt;strong&gt;Requirem for a Dream&lt;/strong&gt;, due to drugs, in the overtly ambitious &lt;strong&gt;The Fountain&lt;/strong&gt;, due to death, and so on. Aronofsky’s film pack a strong stylistic punch, and a good counter to that are the naturalistic films of &lt;strong&gt;Richard Linklater&lt;/strong&gt;. If nothing else, consider &lt;strong&gt;Boyhood&lt;/strong&gt; - a film that took 12 years to film yet managed to pack all that time in 2.5 hour movie most considered successful. Ah, this paragraph is getting long, but I’ll sneak in Paul Thomas Anderson and tell you that &lt;strong&gt;There Will Be Blood&lt;/strong&gt; is great and all and enjoying &lt;strong&gt;The Master&lt;/strong&gt; will get you intellectual street cred but if you have not seen &lt;strong&gt;Punch Drunk Love&lt;/strong&gt; you are missing out on a completely original amazing experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;postimage&quot; src=&quot;https://draftin.com:443/images/33187?token=vLdVZwnULxs7ZtMMgZiVWvGm4gnk2LeEpdivEYS-7XM9TbrfiONSBBNpuWna5hZIpRCLqYcwc9mLbzRy0KynS0M&quot; alt=&quot;Punch Drunk Love&quot; /&gt;     
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hmm, about now the next wacky transition is starting to get harder to think up, so I’ll pull the nice trendy post-modernist trick of self-awareness. Speaking of post-modernism (BAM), it’s about time I brought up Charlie Kaufman. He is distinguished on this list for being the only one who is primarily an author of screenplays, yet it is fair to say his work is unmistakably his. &lt;strong&gt;Synecdoche NY&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Adaptation&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Being John Malkovich&lt;/strong&gt; - fantastic movies about art, love, and life. They speak for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;postimage&quot; src=&quot;https://draftin.com:443/images/33243?token=ra_Hy_oz8XdXfQ2OmIMxeiHYlrraFDoWFPOB75ac8RWwXAamoyV-yU7AKJ7Bm7YF2PV-aKZL4dM6Hdgszfgqp_E&quot; alt=&quot;Synechdoche New York&quot; /&gt;     
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kaufman basically exudes talent. In addition to writing all the above, the people who did direct his films are themselves rockstars of the art film. Spike Jonze (&lt;strong&gt;Adaptation&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Being John Malkovich&lt;/strong&gt;) also directed the magnificent &lt;strong&gt;Her&lt;/strong&gt;, a film that managed to understand that science fiction is not solely a vehicle for action or horror, and a host of fantastic short films: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-0siK1w3eM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kanye West Meets His Demon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OY1EXZt4ok&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robots Can Love Too&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Euj9f3gdyM&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Damn Arcade Fire Is So Fucking Good&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It just so happens that Jonze was also married to Sofia Coppola, whose &lt;strong&gt;Lost in Translation&lt;/strong&gt; is about as good as you can hope from a movie premised about an aged and lonely Bill Murray befriending an existentially wrought Scarlett Johansonn in Japan. Back on topic: Michel Gondry directed the Kaufman written &lt;strong&gt;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&lt;/strong&gt;, a movie perhaps unparalleled in its presentation of dreams and how our inner lives are reflected in them, a joy of a movie owing if only for its inventiveness and emotional resonance. He also directed the enjoyably quirky but perhaps forgettable &lt;strong&gt;Science of Sleep&lt;/strong&gt; and a host of awesome Bjork music videos - this may well be my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4z7NN4n8CTY&quot;&gt;favorite music video ever&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;postimage&quot; src=&quot;https://draftin.com:443/images/33189?token=PgQT7iBEszRhPobAfIVpi0MhbFFyXJzPZb6_ccAE3OSgl-QLcoD-zng2LgsK_dNAiMyVVDsdiu07iUFUYaPX17g&quot; alt=&quot;Her&quot; /&gt;     
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, George Clooney! George Clooney started his directorial work with &lt;strong&gt;Confessions of a Dangerous Mind&lt;/strong&gt;, yet another awesome movie written by Kaufman. Clooney’s later work is not that artsy but he should get way more cred for how good it is. Speaking of which, &lt;strong&gt;Micheal Clayton&lt;/strong&gt;. Clayton is weird only in how damn realistic it is, how fully it acknowledges the way humans are, how non-indie and not-artsy it is in its exploration of those themes. One of my favorites films - get through to the last scene and sit speechless at the genius of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;postimage&quot; src=&quot;https://draftin.com:443/images/33188?token=QVHSTbQt9CQjDuFB9ksPQMtljyhytFPppxoiXTY4BOu-_AjGPE7yS7AKrfL6y0hJpGRIxht5T7OwXcGTIOh0wfY&quot; alt=&quot;Michael Clayton&quot; /&gt;     
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now the tone is getting too heavy - this can be addressed with some exploding heads. David Cronenberg is a peculiar auteur, the true master of body horror through all the eighties and nineties. Just watch the trailer to &lt;strong&gt;Videodrome&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Naked Lunch&lt;/strong&gt;. Just do it. His later work (&lt;strong&gt;Eastern Promises&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt;A History of Violence&lt;/strong&gt;) is strangely normal but still fantastically well made. So if you want to see a TV that has something resembling a vagina, a type writer that has something resembling a vagina, cars that dont have have anything resembling vaginas but are distinctly erotic (I am not making this up), well… Its fair to say you maybe don’t really want to see those things, but the general weirdness of Cronenberg’s early work and its legit thematic underpinnings should be appreciated, as should his basically excellent if more traditional work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;postimage&quot; src=&quot;https://draftin.com:443/images/33244?token=i40M6GIXvMVU8g9GXre0s2Sc0nsmSC7ZaA-jjYa5vb868IpeWbBXFl33n1szTAYyCSyUpY5RWrwHM_N7RKASZjo&quot; alt=&quot;Naked Lunch&quot; /&gt;     
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not interested in seeing inanimate manner being quite so animate, or just want to watch some nice classy art movies? Shane Carruth. The director whom I quite literally proselytize to every one I meet, a software engineer turned auteur filmmaker. &lt;strong&gt;Primer&lt;/strong&gt;. A purportedly $7000 movie about the mind fuck of time travel from the perspective of an engineer, and the corrupting power of power. &lt;strong&gt;Upstream Color&lt;/strong&gt;. A hypnotizing movie that merges sci fi and artfulness in a way I have never seen done - I can think of few dialogue-free scenes as striking as found in this movie. In this case a quote from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/upstream_color/&quot;&gt;RottenTomatoes&lt;/a&gt; feels most appropriate: “As technically brilliant as it is narratively abstract, Upstream Color represents experimental American cinema at its finest – and reaffirms Shane Carruth as a talent to watch.”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;postimage&quot; src=&quot;https://draftin.com:443/images/33245?token=kg1Nlhxmbunc_ReJHx6HwqWV30xzh9BOcZNmpspTQ8DqBgWWGkSDvYwmdDIfV1z4CuMTIK4dwTDPZc-pZl0KHPU&quot; alt=&quot;Upstream Color&quot; /&gt;     
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So many words, yet so little ground covered. Let’s do a quick sweep of the globe - fast now, over in Japan we forgot to mention Ozu, whose excellent &lt;strong&gt;Tokyo Story&lt;/strong&gt; you will surely love, and the more recent Takeshi Kitano with his existentialist gangster films in the vein of &lt;strong&gt;Sonatine&lt;/strong&gt;, and lastly the counterpoint of Hirokazu Koreeda whose &lt;strong&gt;Nobody Knows&lt;/strong&gt; is the best minimalist theme I can think of. But let’s not linger - over in China there is the distinctly weird yet unquestionably interesting Wong Kar-Wai with bizarre dreams like &lt;strong&gt;Chunkgink Express&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Fallen Angels&lt;/strong&gt;, though if you are not into that there is also Johnie To with fantastic Shakespearean gangster tragedies like &lt;strong&gt;The Triad Election&lt;/strong&gt;. Then it just so happens in Korea Park Chan-Wook is both violent and bizarre, most notably in the already-classic &lt;strong&gt;Oldboy&lt;/strong&gt; (and personal favorite blood-dark romantic comedy &lt;strong&gt;Thirst&lt;/strong&gt;), and alongside his work there is as a host of recent fairly normal yet fantastic violent thrillers of which Lee Jeong-beom To’s &lt;strong&gt;The Man From Nowhere&lt;/strong&gt; is surely the best. Not to be all about Asia here, over from Mexico there is Benecio del Toro with the unforgettable WWII fairy tale &lt;strong&gt;Pan’s Labyrith&lt;/strong&gt;, and Alfonso Cuarón has the poignant life tale &lt;strong&gt;Y Tu Mama Tambien&lt;/strong&gt; and the just-please-watch-it-you’ll-be-happy-you-did-masterpiece &lt;strong&gt;Children of Men&lt;/strong&gt;. Let’s mention Britain too, where Richard Ayoade has recently made the excellent coming of age tale &lt;strong&gt;Submarine&lt;/strong&gt; and the somehow yet more delightful adaptation of Dostoevsky &lt;strong&gt;The Double&lt;/strong&gt;. Finally, we wind up in Israel due to the sheer beauty of Ari Folman’s &lt;strong&gt;Waltz with Bashir&lt;/strong&gt; of which you may be convinced with nothing more than the following image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;postimage&quot; src=&quot;https://draftin.com:443/images/33248?token=T20B0DzRAvKHdSt9L2sk_5FRkcwsWKN9dOB5KhoBqLbu3SzSPAsRv4NkJIVN8tME3eVg7N7X-W-TJM83GWbHwMY&quot; alt=&quot;Waltz with Bashir&quot; /&gt;     
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tired yet? I’m impressed you made it this far. Listen, I wonder how to close this thing - I have journeyed through most of my memory and mind and found the scattered pieces of film impressions that are clearly somewhat important to me, yet can I be expected to find some sequence of sentences to sum up all this? No, that would hardly be a reasonable expectation. Rather, I shall close on one last filmmaker, perhaps my favorite, and most certainly one not sufficiently recognized as of yet. That filmmaker is Satoshi Kon, and I must admit his work not to be film strictly - as with the above it is animation, anime (speaking of which, surely I can take for granted you have heard of Miyazake and &lt;strong&gt;Princess Mononoke&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Spirited Away&lt;/strong&gt;). Yet, his work is about film - &lt;strong&gt;Perfect Blue&lt;/strong&gt; with its obvious Hitchcockian inspiration, &lt;strong&gt;Millenium Actress&lt;/strong&gt; with an overt and beautifully rendered and just so damn wonderful recollection of the history of Japanese cinema, and finally &lt;strong&gt;Paprika&lt;/strong&gt; - a movie about the power of dream that may as well equate cinema itself to that act. Vivid, creative, exuberant, surprising, challenging, comedic, touching - Kon’s work is a testament to the power of film, and the fantastic dreams we may inhabit through them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;postimage&quot; src=&quot;https://draftin.com:443/images/33249?token=IyoXEt59YrNKHsBba9nzrRhsj0BS3Oy4kFsqlkaLT4kbX0YsMleiBE_QB3hNHgTgjFJNrkWF93CcVbtU27r0qF0&quot; alt=&quot;Paprika&quot; /&gt;     
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;btn&quot; data-toggle=&quot;collapse&quot; data-target=&quot;#foreword&quot;&gt;
Foreword &amp;raquo;
&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;aside&quot;&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;foreword&quot; class=&quot;collapse&quot; style=&quot;height: 0px;&quot;&gt;
As with most things I write about, this has been rolling about in my head for many years. 
It is the sort of thing I keep hitting up against and wondering at, and eventually crystallize some notion of that calls for itself to be solidified in text. In starting to solidify this into text, I realized that it will be short, and comes from a place particularly likely to call upon the typical impactful literary techniques I use whose names I do not remember. So, I figured, if I am to write a short essay with impassioned sections, why not go all the way and give it the form of a poem. I may not be a poet, but by posting these digital pages of text I do inevitably claim the identity of a writer, of some sort. So, here's an essay poem.

PS shout out, similar thoughts were echoed well in &lt;a href=&quot;http://colorfulcortex.co/2015/10/24/the-youre-not-as-cool-in-person-phenomenon/&quot;&gt;'The “You’re Not as Cool in Person” Phenomenon'&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have seen the shine of exceptional people,&lt;br /&gt;
their radiance of confidence, skill, power,&lt;br /&gt;
their lit up eyes in the midst of inspiration,&lt;br /&gt;
their bright excitement in the flow of creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When? When I have sat with them in cruel extra credit classes,&lt;br /&gt;
and worked with them during brutal nocturnal work slogs,&lt;br /&gt;
and argued with them over specifics in hastily scrawled sketches,&lt;br /&gt;
and drank with them past sundown unfazed by the impending morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I have sensed in them burning hearts,&lt;br /&gt;
or perhaps perpetually caffeinated brains,&lt;br /&gt;
and in those brains always a thought, a plan, an idea,&lt;br /&gt;
and in those hearts always the energy to think, imagine, strive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in me? Often, mired in melancholy, I felt jealousy -&lt;br /&gt;
felt just short of that ascendancy beyond normalcy,&lt;br /&gt;
different but not outstanding, smart but not exceptional,&lt;br /&gt;
the angst of a restless below average overachiever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But! Don’t worry. I grew up, slain that silly impulse, &lt;br /&gt;
long since realized the emptiness of numbers,&lt;br /&gt;
pierced the perceived glow of outstanding people,&lt;br /&gt;
and through it saw, simply, friends, peers, people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just people. Impressive people.&lt;br /&gt;
People who have bad days and tough times.&lt;br /&gt;
People who have dark sides and hidden fears.&lt;br /&gt;
People who make mistakes.&lt;br /&gt;
People who make bad jokes.&lt;br /&gt;
People who struggle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And at first it was distinctly disappointing to see the death of that ideal, &lt;br /&gt;
the impossibility of escaping difficulty dealing with all of life’s damned dimensions. &lt;br /&gt;
Such a typically tepid truth - us mere mortals incapable of that heroic Herculean halo,&lt;br /&gt;
and left to grow to see humans do not live in fairly tales, as I did with those around me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you know, funny thing - in time I liked them all the more for it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/writing/exceptional-people/&quot;&gt;Exceptional People&lt;/a&gt; was originally published by Andrey Kurenkov at &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;Andrey Kurenkov's Web World&lt;/a&gt; on October 11, 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h1 id=&quot;the-present&quot;&gt;The Present&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, I am one of the lucky ones. Right from the start, I lucked out - born male, white, and straight, I was endowed with the US social privilege trifecta. For nothing, no effort at all, I got to have it easy in many ways I most likely don’t even perceive. I was lucky, too, with economic privilege - my parents made my childhood easy and stable, and within the span of that childhood managed to move us from the ranks of middle class in Ukraine to the same in the US. Think that’s impressive? Get this: I got through a top tier college without a penny of debt - cue the tears of millions of my recently graduated peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, big surprise, I ended up getting a degree (well, two) followed by a Software Engineering job which assured my ability to have a very comfortable life. I am 22, and many, too many, in the world cannot even hope for this much. But, insurmountable ethical queasiness about inequality aside, my life is good, right? Right. So then, it’s really a testament to the ingenuity of the human mind and spirit that I am not kicking back and enjoying life, satisfied and content. Oh no, that would make life all too easy and lacking difficult things to write lengthy quasi-essays about. No - in truth, I hope for yet more. Not just a job that pays well, but a job that I find interesting and enjoyable, and not just a job that I find interesting and enjoyable, but a job that I find, crucially, fulfilling. I have no idea what that even means yet, and cannot help but wonder about this drive within me. A comfortable life is nice, but something within me wants for, moreso, a life that feels right - whatever that is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;btn&quot; data-toggle=&quot;collapse&quot; data-target=&quot;#viewdetails&quot;&gt;
An Aside: if you are a coworker of mine - oh, that's awkward, click this &amp;raquo;
&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;aside&quot;&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;viewdetails&quot; class=&quot;collapse&quot; style=&quot;height: 0px;&quot;&gt;
Relax! I am not actually having an existential crisis regarding working at Oracle or elsewhere. See, I am doing this personal narrative intro bit, motivating this giant slab of text to get people into it. 
And, if you happen to not be a coworker of mine, how dare you read this?! Kidding. I sure do hope you found that piece of text amusing; obviously it was a calculated move to dispel the largely self-serious tone found here thus far.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fun though it would be to go into how this connects to humans’ general inability to ever feel content, I can’t claim to be quite so profound. No, this drive for fulfilling work is hardly original these days - it is a common sentiment usually boiled down to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMnJLWeo1z8&quot;&gt;Steve Jobs sactioned&lt;/a&gt; phrase “Do What You Love”. This strand of thinking has become so conventionally accepted that Slate ran an impassioned &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2014/01/do_what_you_love_love_what_you_do_an_omnipresent_mantra_that_s_bad_for_work.html&quot;&gt;critique&lt;/a&gt; against it that begins by stating that “There’s little doubt that ‘do what you love’ is now the unofficial work mantra for our time” and goes on to point out to lucky bastards like me that it is in fact “a secret handshake of the privileged and a worldview that disguises its elitism as noble self-betterment.”  The Atlantic, likewise, has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/09/gig-economy-doublespeak-new-labor/404779/&quot;&gt;rebuked&lt;/a&gt; the concept with eloquent sick burns:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Today’s knowledge economy is defined by a duplicitous charm in its categorical refusal to see work as labor. Desk workers are everywhere encouraged to “love what you do”: to embody their company’s values, identify with its brand, and then celebrate its accomplishments through internal and external marketing. For these creative workers, it is a badge of honor to never be off the clock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, I have a secret handshake!? Second - is this actually true? I’ve already &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.andreykurenkov.com/writing/on-work/&quot;&gt;written&lt;/a&gt; of my fondness for work, so I won’t waste time whining about the articles’ simplistic characterization of me as a privileged workaholic brainwashed by The Man. But, me aside, is this more generally true? With regards to the ‘Millennial’ age group of people who were born sometime between the inception of the NES and that of The Matrix, the group to which I belong, it only takes a quick Google to find that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forbes.com/sites/karlmoore/2014/10/02/millennials-work-for-purpose-not-paycheck/&quot;&gt;“Millennials Work For Purpose, Not Paycheck”&lt;/a&gt;. Except, not really. Look up a piece &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.wsj.com/atwork/2014/09/10/survey-says-everything-you-know-about-millennials-is-wrong/&quot;&gt;backed by some numbers&lt;/a&gt; rather than fun anecdotes, and you find stuff like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Competitive pay is the single biggest contributor to job satisfaction for Millennials and non-Millennials alike, with 68%  and 64% citing it as important or very important, respectively. The second largest factor for both was bonuses and merit-based rewards, at 55% and 56%, respectively.
…
Only one-fifth of each generational group felt that “making a positive difference in the world” had an impact on their satisfaction. And slightly fewer Millennials – 29% versus 31% of other workers – said that achieving work/life balance was a key contributor to their professional happiness. Same thing with “finding personal meaning in work,” where the numbers came out 14% to 17%, in favor of non-Millennials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So much for that story. The likes of me may make up that 14-17%, but it’s clear Do What You Love is hardly a universal mantra. This is the US, and a proclivity for pragmatism is alive and well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, what fun are percentages? For all I know they are entirely made up, since much like you it’s not like I bothered to go back and check the veracity of the study. In typical human fashion, what made me think about this is not numbers, but people. Specifically, the people I interacted with in college. Specifically, the small rank of people in college that, like me, found the time to work on projects not required by any class, simply because they felt like it. Or rather, specifically, that vast majority of people who were not in that rank - who did not go to hackathons, who did not have repositories full of half-finished side projects or tables covered by half a dozen breadboards, who really just generally enjoyed their major and wanted to get a job in that field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many in this great majority of people were about as lucky as me, but seemed to lack my yearning for yet more beyond a good job; it seems to me most enjoyed programming as a whole, but not so much as to do it in their free time, and they wanted little more out of a job than being payed well to do programming they enjoyed. To me, that’s not Do What You Love, but is more like Do Something You Enjoy. That is what I saw in the majority of CS majors who studied alongside me. And, despite my fabulously sheltered life I am aware many more are not so lucky to think even like that, that many have little choice but to embrace Do What You Can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So then, despite the great social, cultural, artistic, and technological transformations of the past century, despite the supposed cultural acceptance of the DWYL idea, despite all that, I am left wondering if our collective cultural view of work is still about the same as ever - a means of trading time and energy for resources necessary for survival and, if lucky, leisure. Many today want the trade to be pleasant and the labor interesting, but still - has much really changed from a century ago?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-past&quot;&gt;The Past&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, fine, obviously much has changed (in the US, at least). Most good jobs now require at least a high school degree, and by extension there are many more jobs that are interesting and require creativity. More people get to be artists, more people get to be engineers, more people get to be just about everything - except farmers and factory workers. More people have jobs that did not exist a century ago than those two, as the anti-DWYL Atlantic article nicely summarizes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Over the past 50 years, the main source of employment in the United States has shifted from the manual to the mental—from doing things with one’s hands to delivering a service or a feeling. As Enrico Moretti points out in his 2013 book The New Geography of Jobs, any given American is now statistically more likely to work in a restaurant than a factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yes, a lot has changed. But, that’s just the particulars of how people prepare for work and what it ends up being. What about why they work, what they work for? Well, it’s hard to say what a mere commoner such as myself thought about it back in the day, since no one kept blogs or posted any tweets. So, let us examine the opinions of those few past lucky bastards whose thoughts survived to this day; starting, of course, with John Smith. Turns out, the papa of capitalist economies certainly had a &lt;a href=&quot;http://monthlyreview.org/2006/10/01/the-meaning-of-work-a-marxist-perspective/&quot;&gt;bleak answer&lt;/a&gt; to those questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Adam Smith, the great theoretician of the capitalist economy, is much more explicit when, in a different context, he defines work as an activity requiring the worker to give up “his tranquility, his freedom, and his happiness.” Wages, according to Smith, are the reward the laborer receives for his or her sacrifices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does not take a sociology or psychology or psychological sociology degree to see that this does not reflect the modern attitude towards work in the US. Yes, for some it may perhaps be accurate, but for great numbers of people (again, lucky people), their work is also their chief metric of success and source of pride. I can nitpick my peers’ zeal for their field all I want, but I think very few would agree they don’t enjoy or take any pleasure and pride in their work. The funny thing is, despite US culture being most encouraging for this sort of work-for-pride thinking it actually follows the thoughts of a certain German who was no big fan of capitalism:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“‘Smith has no inkling whatever that the overcoming of obstacles is in itself a liberating activity—and that, further, the external aims become stripped of the semblance of merely external natural urgencies, and become posited as aims which the individual himself posits—hence as self-realization, objectification of the subject, hence real freedom, whose action is, precisely, labor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, is work still seen through the mindset of Smith, or his great nemesis Marx? According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/30/opinion/sunday/rethinking-work.html?ref=opinion&quot;&gt;one NY Times Opinion Piece&lt;/a&gt;, Smith is still supreme: “Today, in factories, offices and other workplaces, the details may be different but the overall situation is the same: Work is structured on the assumption that we do it only because we have to. “ And yet, the same paper only two weeks before &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/technology/inside-amazon-wrestling-big-ideas-in-a-bruising-workplace.html?ref=technology&quot;&gt;published a scathing piece&lt;/a&gt; discussing how Amazon sought out high achievers and squeezed productivity and innovation out of them like human fruit while promising only the reward of great accomplishments rather than Google-esque utopian work conditions. And so we come to an annoyingly predictable conclusion - the world is grey, and it’s hard to say quite which color is predominant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than pretend to have understanding of the ambiguous, let’s explore the larger truth this Amazon story speaks to - the emergence, over the past few decades, of this new subset of human endeavor chiefly defined by writing software, and its peculiarities. Perhaps uniquely outside of art and philosophy, this field is home to droves of big egos who think they can hit it big, or in the words of an entirely unironic TechCrunch editorial, “&lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/20/do-great-things/&quot;&gt;Do Great Things&lt;/a&gt;”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We who work in technology have nurtured an especially rare gift: the opportunity to effect change at an unprecedented scale and rate. Technology, community, and capitalism combine to make Silicon Valley the potential epicenter of vast positive change. We can tackle the world’s biggest problems and take on bold missions like fixing education, re-imagining energy distribution, connecting people, or even democratizing democracy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core idea of that article is that with great power comes great responsibility, and those of us with the power of programming are like superheroes capable of fixing the world’s woes. A bit much, obviously - the world’s big problems were built with much effort, and software alone is unlikely to move those glaciers far. This sort of thinking has become so common and exaggerated that it has come to be satirized, most notably by the show Silicon Valley - ironically beloved by many in the Valley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, to me the more notable subset of weirdos in the comp sci space is the huge army of people who practice the craft out of genuine enjoyment - me among them. How else could a site like GitHub, a sort of programmer social network notable as much for safely storing code as its social features, become a standard in this big space within a few years. And, furthermore, there sprung up a host of websites to enable people such as myself to code in their free time: &lt;a href=&quot;https://projecteuler.net/&quot;&gt;Project Euler&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.topcoder.com/&quot;&gt;TopCoder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hackerrank.com/&quot;&gt;HackerRank&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://devpost.com/&quot;&gt;DevPost&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://hackaday.com/&quot;&gt;Hackaday&lt;/a&gt;, and even more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s great! Clearly I am of the perspective that work should not be a sacrifice, but an investment - an investment in a pursuit, an idea, yourself. An investment not to change the world, not to be some hero, but just to do something you want. But, clearly, few are quite as invested in this notion as I am. The intrinsically motivated crowd who uses such sites must be small compared to the many more who just enjoy the work but think of it chiefly as such. So, let’s summarize: by and large, employed work is still largely seen as labor, but compared to the past many more people get to be lucky enough to have the freedom to take the Marxist view of work as a means of finding happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-future&quot;&gt;The Future&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, some things have changed, attitude wise, but as Slate and The Atlantic so eloquently pointed out by and large only lucky bastards like me get to benefit from the changes while most still regard work as labor, and not one of love. Fun as it is was to reflect on our present and reminisce about our past, I clearly have to take the next step - ponder our future. Will things change yet more? Yes, of course. So, how?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agent of change will clearly be, as before, technology. And that can only mean one thing - robots! Right? Having worked in robotics I have seen many oh so many pieces about the job eradicating potential of that field - most not worth taking seriously. Robots suck at doing anything halfway intelligent, still, period, and the core of problem that causes the fragility of such intelligent robotic systems - a lack of common sense - is not going to be solved any time soon. Why? Here’s a summary &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.syntouchllc.com/Media/Blog/2013-08-27-The-problem-with-robots/&quot;&gt;“The problem with robots: If they only had a brain”&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the 1960s and 70s, a great wave of enthusiasm for artificial intelligence (AI) in computers based on human thought processes crashed against our sheer ignorance of those processes. Engineers mostly stopped talking about “intelligence” and opted for signal processing algorithms and relational databases that appear to perform intelligently but only within highly scripted tasks - e.g. robots. That is why moving robots from the mindless assembly line into the real world usually produces pitiful, sometimes catastrophic results. If a robot encounters an unfamiliar object or even a familiar one in the wrong orientation, it is likely to proceed extremely cautiously or to damage the object or itself by handling it inappropriately. A human worker that inept would be fired immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so there are precious few examples of robots out there in the wild, doing things that humans do that also happen to be more complicating than endlessly executing the same repetitive motion in a caged factory. And, as was pointed out relatively few jobs (in the US) are based on physical labor, and it’s even less clear that people would like awkward robots to replace their human counterparts in jobs requiring social interaction. The non-factory robots out there are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boston.com/business/technology/gallery/consumerrobots/&quot;&gt;for the most part&lt;/a&gt; in the vein or the Roomba or are more specialized tools meant for hospitals or film sets, and despite &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rethinkrobotics.com/baxter/&quot;&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jibo.com/&quot;&gt;interesting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.savioke.com/&quot;&gt;efforts&lt;/a&gt; I would stake my measly reputation on the idea that it’ll still be decades before significant amount of US jobs will be threatened with robotic automation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;btn&quot; data-toggle=&quot;collapse&quot; data-target=&quot;#roboticsaside&quot;&gt;
An Aside: more on the state of robotics &amp;raquo;
&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;aside&quot;&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;roboticsaside&quot; class=&quot;collapse&quot; style=&quot;height: 0px;&quot;&gt;
I am being a little harsh here. Okay, quite harsh. Robotics as a field has actually been moving incredibly rapidly in the past decade towards intelligent automation that goes beyond the cute little Roomba. The clearest success story is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Robotics&quot;&gt;Kiva Systems&lt;/a&gt;, which greatly improved the efficiency of warehouses and has led to more ambitious efforts such as those of &lt;a href=&quot;http://fetchrobotics.com/&quot;&gt;Fetch Robotics&lt;/a&gt;. I suspect the next great success stories will come from agriculture, where companies such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.precisionhawk.com/&quot;&gt;Precision Hawk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bluerivert.com/&quot;&gt;Blue River Technology&lt;/a&gt; are paving the way towards data-driven decisions for farmers that could be executed more precisely by steel machinery rather than meaty muscle. And though I called the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rethinkrobotics.com/baxter/&quot;&gt;Baxter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jibo.com/&quot;&gt;Jibo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.savioke.com/&quot;&gt;Savioke&lt;/a&gt; 'interesting', they are hugely promising for starting the push towards smarter cooperative robots in the factory, funner social robots in the home, and more pleasant robotics in the service industry respectively. I just don't expect these efforts to have widespread impact for decades yet, based on their slow start and the difficulty of robotics in general. Oh yes! And there are the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/selfdrivingcar/&quot;&gt;self&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/2015/07/crummy-highways-delaying-self-driving-tesla/&quot;&gt;driving&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.engadget.com/2015/03/25/mercedes-f015-luxury-self-driving-car/&quot;&gt;cars&lt;/a&gt;. Even I am not enough of a skeptic to deny the awesome impact that self driving cars will soon have.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But! That is not to say things are not set to change. Oh, they so are. But, the big bad boy who will bring in about change is not robotics, at least not it alone. Moreso, it’ll be our old economic grandpa, declining costs, our good old friend, increasing computing power, and our new hip friends, Big Data and Machine Learning. With the steady march of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/M/Moores_Law.html&quot;&gt;Moore’s Law&lt;/a&gt; yet unabated, computers have gotten fast enough, and algorithms good enough, that robotics can now figure out such complicated things as how to grasp items or move very complicated arms for arbitrary goals while avoiding collisions - things that used to be basically intractable. And this trend will continue, until decades will have passed, and the long foretold future of robotic automation will quite inevitably get here. But, since that is a while off let’s talk about something else - how the exponential rise of computing power and improvement in algorithms has enabled another, and in the short term more significant advance - the amazing feats accomplished by the field of Machine Learning in the past several years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;btn&quot; data-toggle=&quot;collapse&quot; data-target=&quot;#machinelearning&quot;&gt;
An Aside: one paragraph summary of Machine Learning &amp;raquo;
&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;aside&quot;&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;machinelearning&quot; class=&quot;collapse&quot; style=&quot;height: 0px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning&quot;&gt;Machine Learning (ML)&lt;/a&gt; is really not as fancy as it sounds. Take a bunch of points on a 2D graph and find the nicest line (straight, hyperbolic, whatever you like) to fit through them, and you've got a form of basic machine learning - a general way to get some output from some input, gotten from some set of examples of correct input and output. Do this line fitting trick a bunch, and make the Y of some lines become the X for some other lines, and maybe likewise make the X for some lines the Y for other lines, and you've got a 'neural net'. This is oversimplifying things, of course, but captures the idea at the heart of the field. It is computer scientists' best attempt at equipping computers with humans' greatest strength - pattern detection and generalization of learned things to new situations. This is conceptually incredibly useful, since tasks that are very difficult or impossible to write programs for (say, figuring out whether an image has a cat or a cactus in it) but that we as humans can easily do can suddenly be taught to the computer. Trouble is, really tough tasks like recognizing what people say or what is in an image did not work so well, so ML was very cool but largely not practical for real problems - until recently.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what has been going on with ML recently? A LOT. Several key insights, the most significant being to use better computing power with GPUs and a better scaling ML algorithm called Convolutional Neural Nets, has led to massive gains in how well the techniques can be applied to large amounts of data nicely &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ViNeWhC24&quot;&gt;summarized&lt;/a&gt; by one of the architect of the movements, Andrew NG. By the way, the seemingly fancy term Deep Learning=GPUs+CNNs. At the same time, this whole Big Data trend came about, and companies like Google and Facebook and many others started applying these research techniques to their Absurd amounts of data. This confluence has led to many amazing research advancements in the past several years and has made the people responsible for these advancements very successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how does this relate to jobs again? One word: automation. Or, more correctly, computerisation. Computers have obviously already had a huge impact on how many jobs are done, and relegated many jobs to the past. But until now, they have largely just been excellent tools to be wielded by humans - hugely empowering, but not able to do much without being set in motion by the squishy brain of a human being. And the things we set in motion! Despite just being really fast calculators, computers have been used for so much more than computation - art, science, communication, exploration, and so much. But, without a person at the helm, computers are still left to follow a very rigid set of steps and instructions, and it turns out we just can’t figure out instructions for things humans are really good at, like recognizing speech and finding cute cat pictures on the internet. Until now. Machine Learning is now empowering the hard silicon logic computers to do things that used to be entirely within the domain of squishy human brains - and in some cases, empowering computers to do those things better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please, don’t take my word on it. What do I know, really? Take the word of academics who spent years crafting an excellent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/The_Future_of_Employment.pdf&quot;&gt;2013 paper from Oxford&lt;/a&gt; that explored this idea in much detail, and ended up finding that 47% could be automated right out.  Really - don’t take my word for it, read it. Or, at least read this excerpt:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Historically, computerisation has largely been conﬁned to manual and cognitive routine tasks involving explicit rule-based activities  (Autor and Dorn, 2013; Goos, et al., 2009). Following recent technological advances, however, computerisation is now spreading to domains
commonly deﬁned as non-routine.
…
Although the extent of these developments remains to be seen, estimates by MGI (2013) suggests that sophisticated algorithms could substitute for approximately 140 million full-time knowledge workers worldwide. Hence, while technological progress throughout economic history has largely been conﬁned to the mechanisation of manual tasks, requiring physical labour, technological progress in the twenty-ﬁrst century can be expected to contribute to a wide
range of cognitive tasks, which, until now, have largely remained a human
domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the paper later points out, the development of ML will likewise expand the reach of robotics beyond the drudgery or repetitive industrial work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Mobile robotics provides a means of directly leveraging ML technologies to
aid the computerisation of a growing scope of manual tasks. The continued technological development of robotic hardware is having notable impact upon
employment: over the past decades, industrial robots have taken on the routine tasks of most operatives in manufacturing. Now, however, more advanced
robots are gaining enhanced sensors and manipulators, allowing them to perform non-routine manual tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sort of talk scares people. And perhaps it should - change is scary. And when thoughts of scary change come about, people who do not habitually read ML and robotics papers start to take notice. A fantastic &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU&amp;amp;app=desktop&quot;&gt;youtube video essay&lt;/a&gt; just on this topic has garners 5 million views, and generated much fanfare on internet communities such as reddit. But, fantastic though it is, it is also wrong. The video covers much of the same content as I have expressed above, quite eloquently, but completely overstates the degree of machine intelligence we can predict at present. Robot baristas, self-driving cars, factories with cooperative robots, news bots - all of that is likely to happen soon, or is happening. But robots capable of writing anything as conceptually complicated as this, or the sort of software that I write for work, or even move with the agility of waiters - these are a long long time off, and perhaps will never fully come to fruition. Like &lt;a href=&quot;http://observer.com/2015/08/stephen-hawking-elon-musk-and-bill-gates-warn-about-artificial-intelligence/&quot;&gt;Elon Musk, Bill Gates, and Stephen Hawking&lt;/a&gt;, the writer makes predictions from current trends that I (as someone who does habitually read ML and robotics papers) find unrealistic, and unreasonable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk and Bill Gates and Stephen Hawking seem like a pretty impressive bunch, so where do I get the nerve to call them out on being excessively worried about AI? Well, that would take a whole separate 5000 word quasi-essay to go into. So, let instead call on the power of Ethos and present the sentiments &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/03/19/andrew_ng_baidu_ai/&quot;&gt;Andrew Ng&lt;/a&gt;, someone actually leading those revolutionary advances in the field, has expressed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Those of us on the frontline shipping code, we’re excited by AI, but we don’t see a realistic path for our software to become sentient. There’s a big difference between intelligence and sentience. There could be a race of killer robots in the far future, but I don’t work on not turning AI evil today for the same reason I don’t worry about the problem of overpopulation on the planet Mars.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it’s just too early to look that far in the future - it is entirely possible the capabilities of the present surge of AI systems will again plateau, and true cognitive intelligence will not become a reality. This plateau may and likely will be one with millions fewer jobs, and much more futur-y with robots and the like all about, but it will not be a drastic feature where all human endeavor is automated or humans are entirely done away with in favor of machines. There are &lt;a href=&quot;http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/05/22/ai-researchers-on-ai-risk/&quot;&gt;strong&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html&quot;&gt;arguments&lt;/a&gt; for why we should be generally aware of the progress of AI, but they do not make a compelling case that such a future is inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;btn&quot; data-toggle=&quot;collapse&quot; data-target=&quot;#singularity&quot;&gt;
An Aside: for the few of you screaming in your head about The Singularity or Superintelligence right now &amp;raquo;
&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;aside&quot;&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;singularity&quot; class=&quot;collapse&quot; style=&quot;height: 0px;&quot;&gt;
I really cannot reasonably get into those book length explorations of the future. Suffice it to say that the presumption of persistent exponential returns with technology is not well supported - fundamental physical or conceptual principles may halt the progress of computational power and make an AI driven utopia unfeasible. I grant you I still have not read either Kurzweil's or Bostom's arugments in full, but I have not been convinced that we should be more than conscious of the possibility at present.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, millions of jobs is not nothing! And so we finally turn back to the question: how will these economic and technological changes affect attitudes toward work? The answer, or my answer, is predictable: I hope that with diminishing numbers of routine somewhat-creative jobs, work as a whole will increasingly be seen as something that should be interesting, creative, and ultimately fulfilling. And eventually - eventually - the notion of how our economy works may have to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-scarcity_economy&quot;&gt;completely revised&lt;/a&gt; to account for the ability of intelligent robots to take care of most human work, and the dreams of Marx finally get realized into some form of actual utopica where people work as a creative and personal pursuit rather than an economic transaction with society. But, in the near future, we can just hope that the dire existential straits immortalized in Office Space will be no more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;back-to-the-present&quot;&gt;Back To The Present&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But all of that is far off, and for all we know our world will be lucky enough to instead get the beautifully dreadful future of Blade Runner. So rather than dread or anticipate the changes of the future, we better worry about our incredibly imperfect present. At the same time, we ought not forget the past, and appreciate how far we have come - people live longer, are happier, and are more educated than in the past. There are still relatively very few people as lucky as me out there, but that’s changing, and as a rule of thumb &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm5xF-UYgdg&amp;amp;feature=share&quot;&gt;most things are getting better&lt;/a&gt;. And me? I just finished writing this absurdly long think piece for no real reason beyond feeling like it - so it seems I am doing alright.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I started out the project thinking i’d do something much lower-level, but ended up working mostly on high-level frameworks with an existing beacon devkit. Thanks to (for once) things mostly working as we expected, we completed the vast majority of the project in about a month. Not bad, considering we made an Android app, a Django-based website (with significant frontends and backends), and a Pebble app. The data being in a standard GTFS format certainly helped, since we were bootstrapped by existing Django extensions for that. We did not get top three, but getting 1.5k for the best beacon award is not bad.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I may have to do a complete write up on this later, but suffice it to say this site has had quite an oddysey. It started out as a Django project, which I undertook not only to create a portfolio (prior to my job search), but also to get a modicum of experience with web development since I had zilch at that point. The journey of this site from not-quite finished Django thing to beautiful Jekyll blog has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.andreykurenkov.com/writing/hello-to-andreykurenkov-com/&quot;&gt;already been told&lt;/a&gt;, but the addition of the ‘projects’ section you are now parousing is itself quite the tale. To keep it short:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The site was based on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/&quot;&gt;Minimal Mistakes&lt;/a&gt; theme with some customization, and I ended up plundering the same designer’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://mmistakes.github.io/skinny-bones-jekyll/&quot;&gt;Skinny Bones&lt;/a&gt; theme for the project page layout - thanks! I also plundered my old Django site design for each project’s layout - never throw out unfinished projects folks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Introducing a whole new category to the site complicated things, and forced me to bite the bullet and &lt;a href=&quot;http://charliepark.org/jekyll-with-plugins/&quot;&gt;start using plugins&lt;/a&gt;. And by using plugins, I mean heavily borrowing from others for things I needed, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://ajclarkson.co.uk/blog/jekyll-category-post-navigation/&quot;&gt;category based navigation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://charliepark.org/tags-in-jekyll/&quot;&gt;plugin-based tag pages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finally, having bitten that bullet I needed to say to having GitHub build my site from source - plugins are just too dangerous. But, with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://davidensinger.com/2013/04/deploying-jekyll-to-github-pages/&quot;&gt;bit of guidance&lt;/a&gt; that switch was pretty easy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up, custom photo gallery! I highly recommend using this framework for your personal site, the design of it is simply fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“I love writing. I get a kick out of sharing my thoughts with others. The act of transforming ideas into words is an amazingly efficient way to solidify and refine your thoughts about a given topic. “ -Tom Preston (creator of Jekyll), &lt;a href=&quot;http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html&quot;&gt;Blogging Like a Hacker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-this-place-came-into-existence&quot;&gt;How This Place Came Into Existence&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello there. Thanks for visiting my site. How do you like it? Fun fact: the publication date of this post is also the date that &lt;em&gt;andreykurenkov.com&lt;/em&gt; went live on the wild lands of the internet. Fun fact #2: it’s been more than a year since I originally started working on developing such a site. Why do it? For one, because I had not done any web development before that and a lack of knowledge of how to do something clearly makes it all the more worthwhile to do.  And that aside it was already quite worthwhile, partially for the transparently prideful reason of wanting to document my miscellaneous projects in style, but most of all simply to build something that felt like my own space to express myself through (inspired significantly by the magnificent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paulgraham.com/&quot;&gt;Paul Graham&lt;/a&gt;). So then, why did it take a year to get finished? Well, like I said, I had not done &lt;strong&gt;any&lt;/strong&gt; web development beforehand, yet had some grand ambitions for the site’s design and reactive behavior. Following the Django tutorial was easy enough, but wrangling HTML and CSS to fullfil my lofty vision proved significantly harder, and having to figure out how to use jQuery was the cherry on top of the technological stack pie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;/writing/images/2015-08-05-hello-to-andreykurenkov-com/website.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/writing/images/2015-08-05-hello-to-andreykurenkov-com/website.png&quot; class=&quot;postimage&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;A prototype projects portfolio page. Entirely custom HTML and CSS - I was young, and inexperienced...&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so I got far in that summer, learned the Django and prototyped a static portfolio page in HTML and CSS, but ultimately stopped at the 80% point and got distracted by other things. And then, as tends to happen, my overabundance of free time ran out as I went back to college and the project hibernated for a good long while. I did get back to it during the bliss of Winter Break, but (as tends to happen) I then only got it to the 95% point (the point at which all major problems are solved and interesting functionality implemented) but lacked the will to do the remaining 5% (the content entry and bothersome debugging part). Meanwhile, I had continued to update the significantly less ambitious &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lifeofandrey.wordpress.com&quot;&gt;lifeofandrey.wordpress.com&lt;/a&gt;, also begun the summer before on a whim but steadily maintained. And so although the Django site never mde it to anything beyong being served by a debug server, the Wordpress blog steadily filled with content, and my fondness for producing this content likewise increased. Now, fast forward past my senior year of college and some months thereafter - I once again found myself with plenty of free time and a desire for a more personal web existence. All it took was a glance over one Facebook post that mentioned Jekyll, and my work on this site began anew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/andreykurenkov/minimal-mistakes/commits/master&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/writing/images/2015-08-05-hello-to-andreykurenkov-com/commits.png&quot; class=&quot;postimage&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Commits logs do not lie.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-jekyll&quot;&gt;Why Jekyll&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll is a tool for generating static websites (a bunch of HTML files and other files lacking code) from a bunch of templates and associated YAML files. Software engineers explaining why they ported their blog to it from a service such as Wordpress.com &lt;a href=&quot;http://ocramius.github.io/blog/moving-my-blog-to-jekyll/&quot;&gt;is&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://hadihariri.com/2013/12/24/migrating-from-wordpress-to-jekyll/&quot;&gt;practically&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.girliemac.com/blog/2013/12/27/wordpress-to-jekyll/&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://jbeckwith.com/2013/07/17/wordpress-to-jekyll/&quot;&gt;genre&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://damien.krotkine.com/2011/04/30/migrating-to-jekyll.html&quot;&gt;nowdays&lt;/a&gt;, so let me summarize: it’s easy, it’s fully yours to customize, static content means it’s fast, and hosting could not be simpler thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages support&lt;/a&gt;. One of the major hurdles I did not clear with my Django effort was figuring out how to actually put my website on the internet on my own custom domain, which I had &lt;a href=&quot;/old.html&quot;&gt;already done&lt;/a&gt; on GitHub Pages and knew to be &lt;a href=&quot;http://davidensinger.com/2013/03/setting-the-dns-for-github-pages-on-namecheap/&quot;&gt;super simple&lt;/a&gt;. The moment that cemented my confidence in using Jekyll was finding the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/theme-setup/&quot;&gt;magnificent Minimal Mistakes theme&lt;/a&gt;. It was truly the best of both the wordpress and Django worlds: an off-the-shelf great looking theme that I could endlessly tinker with to my heart’s content. And tinkering with it has proven to be nothing but fun, with most major lacking Wordpress features a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.minddust.com/post/tags-and-categories-on-github-pages/&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; [Search][http://realjenius.com/2012/11/03/jekyll-series-list/] away. That the simplicity of the tool requires ingenuity to implement some fancier ideas only makes it all the more fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;todo&quot;&gt;TODO&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know you must be very impressed by the mighty feat of this site’s creation, but the truth is that I have taken the lazy road in posting this today - it’s not even finished yet! Much more is to come&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create projects category to replace work in nav bar and be distinct from writing&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Basically, fulfill my original ambition with the Django site. The more involved layout with images
will not be trivial, but should be entirely doable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create custom Photography pages instead of linking to 500px&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Though 500px is a fine site I quite enjoy browsing, it’s not fun to just link to it instead of 
hosting the photographs myself. Luckily, a neat hidden little feature of Lightroom is static 
html gallery generator&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eventually transform the site into my own distinct theme.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Because my efforts in life seems perpetually aimed at becoming my own ideal role model, I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;you-can-do-it-too&quot;&gt;You Can Do It Too!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes! Even people with zero programming or wev dev experience can quite easily create their own www.myname.com site using Jekyll. The quite from &lt;a href=&quot;http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/theme-setup/&quot;&gt;Minimal Mistakes&lt;/a&gt; is excellent,  but &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllbootstrap.com/usage/jekyll-quick-start.html&quot;&gt;Jekyll Bootstrap makes it even easier&lt;/a&gt;. It’s really great fun, so if you actuall read all the above text and are now tempted to walk the same path - by all means, do!&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">
    &lt;p&gt;Or, why I relish work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, completely overloaded with work in the lead up to my graduation (TAing, research, senior design, 4 or so other classes, working on a solar car, various projects…), I started writing a blog post: “This time I’ve really done it. After years of walking ever closer to the edge of too-much-work by simultaneously increasing my number of commitments and their difficulty, I came close to falling over that edge and stared down the spiraling flaming abyss of burn out. And I still am looking down at that abyss, overly brazen despite having just figured out my precarious position.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was all I ever wrote of that blog post. I did not end up falling into that spiraling pit, with some difficulty and a few failures, and enjoyed the expected post graduation period of slovenly laziness. I even took a proper, if short, vacation. And then I boarded my flight to the Bay Area and spent the next month tediously completing my move here. And now I am back in what could be called a routine, and again feel as I did a few months ago: relentlessly restless to do things. In the excess of free time I now have working full time, I feel eager to: socialize more, read more, watch more, write more (score!), exercise more, photograph more, cook more, hack more, and learn much much more (Chinese, driving, data science, etc.). The items on the list are somewhat different, but the drive is the same: to do a lot, to use my time productively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? Why this drive for doing a lot. Simple: because I feel like it. Because I want to do these things. I wanted to get two majors, so I did. I wanted to TA, to do research, to work on a solar car, to compete in hackathons, so I did. I wanted, and want, to do these things because I find them challenging, rewarding, interesting. I want to do these things because they allow me to affect the world, to grow, to be creative, to express myself and to better understand what I want to express. And now I want to write, to photograph, to appreciate art, to meet new people and spend time with old friends, to exercise, to keep working on technical projects in my free time - all for roughly the same reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is great, and all, but not to say I don’t enjoy completely unproductive activities so hugely enabled by the internet - browsing reddit, for instance. Work requires energy and time (and so does socializing, and appreciating art), and this energy needs to be replenished. So overindulging in work, as with anything, is unhealthy; the term workaholic has a negative connotation, and rightfully so. When I wrote the quote above, I was acutely aware that I had gone too far, taken on too much, and my life was out of balance. Even given my proclivity for taking on a lot, the period was tiring and stressful, and acknowledging that was in part what drove to start writing this blog post those few months ago. Questioning this habit of mine, whether it is overkill, is wise; should I be more relaxed, less eager - different?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, not really. I am not a workaholic, in the sense that doing work is not the basis for my self worth, and I never was. Prudent though it was to consider the notion, as of writing this I find the truth to still simply be that I take great joy in being eclectic, and doing many things, even if it is not easy, perhaps especially because it is not easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, what of work-work? The office work, the job work. Well, that’s new. And that is also what drove me to revive this blog post so long past its inception. But, my time is spent, so for now I leave you with the promise of a soon to be follow-up post tentatively titled &lt;strong&gt;On Employment&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a week now, I’ve been consuming half my calories in the form of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soylent_(drink)&quot;&gt;Soylent&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of eating a normal breakfast and lunch, I drink the liquidy non-food and perhaps have a coffee to spice things up. This is peculiar, admittedly, but to my surprise very few people I talk to have seemed to agree with the benefits of this regime; more often, they expressed little but disdain and mockery towards it. I don’t mind, but think their dismissal of it implies a lack of understanding, which of course is a most common and unfortunate condition for us humans. So, I will clarify - this is why I consume Soylent:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is convenient&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I resent the notion that I am hard wired to enjoy food. With few exceptions, I enjoy food in a purely physical manner, without any degree of emotional or social gratification (in contrast sex, which the astute reader may note is another hard wired pleasure, most definitely does gratify in those ways). I understand that most people do not have this relationship with food, but I do. And that means that I often regard eating as a chore - necessary, but not really fulfilling, or not as fulfilling as getting something done, as talking to someone cool, as many things. That’s why I am thin - my diet is not particularly healthy, but filled with periods of fasting in which hunger or prudence are not sufficiently compelling reasons to get, much less make, and consume food.
This is not healthy, obviously - the effect, that is, and not the cause (let’s not get into a whole discussion of hedonism right now, though). And so, having finished college and filled myself with the intent to forge a yet more fulfilling and balanced life, I seek to correct this imbalance. And so given my preference for activities not involving making or even sometimes eating food, Soylent makes perfect sense. I spend a few minutes preparing it at night, let it cool in the fridge, and have my breakfast and lunch set for the next two days. Convenient.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is healthy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;When I was in college, a typical breakfast was a sandwich, or some yogurt, or nothing at all. My lunches were likewise at best sandwiches, and for dinner if I got ambitious I would throw some pasta and vegetables in a pan. Hardly a balanced diet, nor a consistent one. Soylent is simple - it has everything that’s recommended for you, in basically the right proportions. I could never achieve that with normal food, even if I tried. There are not yet scientific studies showing consistent consumption of it does not make the body accept the included nutrition, true, but all indications I could find suggest liquid intake of the nutrients &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/wellness/pros-and-cons-of-soylent/2014/09/16/09411d3c-386b-11e4-8601-97ba88884ffd_story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;will work just fine&lt;/a&gt;. Consuming it also make management of calorie intake incredibly simple, bowel nonsense nonexistent, and poisoning impossible (unless you have enemies, in which case poisoning is actually much easier - I’ll take the risk). And, in not giving up eating normal food entirely, I am still retaining variety and flexibility likely best had for a good diet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is affordable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Simple. Let’s pick a subscription, let’s say for 14 bags - $130. That’s 28 days of breakfast and lunch, but let’s up that to 32.5 to include weekends and other occasions. As you can yourself confirm, $130/32.5=$4. That’s $4 for a day’s breakfast and lunch, not including the large amounts of time saved. A totally rice-based diet may compare to this, yes, but just about any typical diet would cost me much more. And in the end of the day, I like to spend my money frivolously on other things.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It makes me appreciate food more&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Soylent tastes alright. It’s sort of like pancake batter, but just mildly sweet - I actually quite like it. But even after only a week, the thought of getting a sandwich for lunch makes me excited. That excitement is new, grown out of lack of indulgence in tasty foods so easy for me as a well-off American (and perhaps easier as a not well-off American).
Also: I now intend to learn to cook actual meals for my dinners. Admittedly, I mostly like this plan for the sake of its own utility, but the greater appreciation for solid food with non pancake-batter taste certainly helps.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It prepares me for life in space&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Because who knows where I will be in 40 years…&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;“I just finished The Last of Us, and have enough exciting developed thoughts on it to want to write them down. Once the semester starts again I probably won’t have time for these sorts of things, but I will keep indulging myself while I can. Maybe I’ll get on a proper blogging site eventually, if only to hyperlink.” -Facebook Note, January 3 2014&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Last of Us and Bioshock Infinite, two AAA games aka games with astounding production values and traditional game design that have you play an antihero that shoots and kills hundreds of people and sort-of-people. Also, both games explicitly and noticeably aspiring to be Serious Art. Mainstream reviewers gave both games reviews full of put-it-on-the-box quotes followed by numbers that averaged up to Great-Metacritic-averages, and both will no doubt got their own special Game of the Year Edition. But these days there lurk critics, in the corners of the internet, that write blog posts with no numbers attached and, for instance, point out that it is very hard to make anything resembling a serious story when the main character killing hundreds of people is a requirement (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magicalwasteland.com/mw/2012/5/1/dumbness-in-games-or-the-animal-as-a-system.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;This one&lt;/a&gt; is great, you should read it, and even moreso &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8157257/line-explores-reasons-why-play-shooter-games&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;.). These critics have written a large volume of analysis, with much of it quite nonplussed by the traditional slaughter-based gameplay loops of these games; it can roughly be summarized as “:/”, with Bioshock Infinite getting an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.actionbutton.net/?p=3006&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;especially&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ2cSKBFBDQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;large&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://leighalexander.net/bioshock-infinite-now-is-the-best-time/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;amount&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.snakelinksonic.com/2013/04/theres-subtlety-then-theres-cowardice.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;negative&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://tevisthompson.com/on-videogame-reviews/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;criticism&lt;/a&gt; and The Last of Us &lt;a href=&quot;http://normallyrascal.wordpress.com/2013/12/02/the-ladder-of-us/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;getting&lt;/a&gt; its &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quartertothree.com/fp/2013/06/12/the-last-of-us-has-real-heart-but-not-much-else/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;own&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAzqDgKYfiM&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;respectable&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/9366466/tom-bissell-naughty-dog-latest-game-last-us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;share&lt;/a&gt;. Besides the fact that such writing even exists and has an audience, I want to tell you why I mostly agree with the criticism of Bioshock Infinite and mostly disagree with the criticism of The Last of Us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both games are accused of having rote gameplay that is disconnected from their Serious Art narrative. And indeed, Bioshock Infinite is a sad simplified shadow of the gameplay of Bioshock that has faceless meaningless soldiers instead of the fantastically personified splicers, half-hearted materialize-this-or-that options instead of a rich group of interacting systems, and a boringly linear course made artificially more exciting with ridiculous skylines instead of rich and rewarding exploration. Worse yet, with few exception the mechanics feel utterly disconnected from the narrative with not even an attempt to connect them, and the rehashed scattered recordings trick does more to hurt the storytelling than to improve it. The few choices that are there feel thrown in and meaningless, and aside from some enemy variety the fighting is largely monotonous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the gameplay of The Last of Us can similarly be lampooned as nothing more than the stealth/shooting mechanics from Uncharted 2 with some crafting on the side, it deserves more credit than that. There are many reasons for this, but most of all because it does something unique among games involving the murder of hundreds of people - it is designed not to to create the typical power trip pleasure, but rather an almost opposite feeling to that. In any of the numerous times you are faced with too many enemies to kill with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbLOokeC3VU&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;too few bullets&lt;/a&gt;, and in any of the numerous times you are suddenly spotted and all hell breaks loose and you have to run back to find some cover before you are dead, the best word for the feeling of the combat is “desperate.” The crafting mechanics here are perhaps the best use of the idea I have seen, in that they are crucial - getting by without the things you craft would be a nightmare, and diligent and thorough scavenging is encouraged not by some artificial scoring system by the sheer need for the items you can make. The weapon upgrades here, unlike in Bioshock, make a significant difference, a crucial difference. Even the melee is a success of simple but effective design that involves the player just enough in each brutal execution by making a badly timed blow badly fail. All of this, for a game clearly inspired by The Road and about survival at its most extreme, is fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so one game trots out a watered-down mix of old tropes having nothing to do with the games artistic intentions and the other game thrives on a smartly tuned and subtly different combat mechanics totally appropriate for its narrative. This difference in coherence and confidence is also reflected in the narrative of both games. Bioshock Infinite has been rightfully called out in most serious writing about the game for bringing up the issues of racism and jingoism in America’s past only to say nothing meaningful about those issues and instead forget about them in favor of weird half-coherent science fiction towards the game’s ending. Although I think it’s possible to interpret the game in a way that ties all the game’s subplot coherently, this does not excuse the game from being horrible about presenting such an interpretation elegantly and rather seeming confused about what, if anything, it wants to say about the ideologies and out-there science fiction that make up its story. That there are now many writers that do not ignore all these flaws is a great thing for the medium even if it is a bad thing for Bioshock Infinite as Serious Art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not so with The Last of Us. Although it should be recognized as still having more in common with 28 Days Later than The Road, I was struck with how many things worth praising are subtly in the game. The story and characters themselves, which are surprisingly understated and rich. In fact, it is influenced by and successfully learns from the narrative achievements of the original Bioshock - much moreso than Infinite. Though there is a larger story, it is told with more self contained episodes with very distinct settings and arcs that all add up to a bigger understanding of this world. This place-as-story design is made all the better by having the characters actually interact and comment on their sorroundings, which all the more grounds the reality of the game’s world. And there are so many small interactions between the characters, such as quick exchanges as simple as “be careful” or the other character enabling you to progress, that serve to make their relationship real (again, another thing Bioshock Infinite has but does not do nearly as well). All of this, within the gameplay and not the masterfully crafted cutscenes. And because of that, I disagree with the seemingly many that think the gameplay is just as divorced from the narrative as it is in Bioshock or other AAA games. Traditional though it is, the gameplay here does reinforce the narrative, and moreso than the vast majority of big-budget games. Disregarding all of this, the game is worth playing only for its ending - goddamn, that ending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, both games are great and worth playing. However, Bioshock Infinite seriously fails in its naked ambition to be taken seriously, and The Last of Us does not. The latter still has major flaws, most notably that it has large portions of gameplay that do not move the narrative at all. Still, I was surprised to find myself having a very novel experience with its completely unoriginal mechanics and think it succeeds as a game striving to have a serious narrative. You should play it.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">
    &lt;p&gt;It has been more than 4 months since I &lt;a href=&quot;https://lifeofandrey.wordpress.com/2015/02/15/some-thoughts-on-being/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;lectured the world&lt;/a&gt; on my lofty principles, so it would seem unlikely I should have much to add. But, it is now clear those thoughts were suited to that time, a time of overwork and discipline and grand ambitions in the lead up to my graduation from college. Now, that time is past, and I am now defining the next era of my life on the opposite coast of the US . Many of my ambitions did not pan out, and the road to graduation and subsequent transition were hardly smooth; in short, I have gone through some things and thought of some more principles I have grown to try to abide by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, all things to strive for, some realistic and some less so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;be-cool&quot;&gt;Be Cool&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in, don’t care too much. Or, more eloquently stated, &lt;a href=&quot;http://markmanson.net/not-giving-a-fuck#.hwpgi0:hQr2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;don’t give too many fucks&lt;/a&gt;. Be careful with feelings, as has been covered, but particularly careful about feeling worried and concerned. The article linked explains why we should do so in quite good detail, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/06/taming-mammoth-let-peoples-opinions-run-life.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; quite nicely explores the stupid reasons for our failure to do so, so read them first. Done? I hope you feel enlightened. My contribution here shall just be to tell you how I came to agree with those finely written essays, my view of their topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was in middle school, a recent immigrant to the US, I was introverted and socially anxious enough to routinely worry about such simple interactions as getting lunch, and simple acts of awkwardness impacted me greatly. Typical, I know, but I hardly saw it as such at the time. But, in dealing with this problem I eventually realized several things: a) I mostly do not know the people I interact with, and likely will not interact with them again b) Most people around me don’t really care about my existence, and if something does call it to their attention they will soon forget c) I should not care about most peoples’ existence, for it does not affect my own. So I realized my worrying was, for the most part, silly, and that made it gradually yet greatly subside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, my life was hardly full of measured calm from then on. In High School, I was once again irrationally worried, this time about getting good grades. Dissatisfied with low As, devastated by Cs. This continued to college, where I became histrionically concerned over not acing some tests in my first semester. But then, I easily got straight As in that semester. And so soon I realized: a) A single grade does not determine my final grade b) My final grade barely affects my GPA c) A 0.02 variance in my GPA barely affects anything at all. So I mostly stopped worrying about grades, and got mostly As and some Bs and spent my time much more wisely than I would have had I gotten straight As in college.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is, very few problems in my life have been worth taking seriously - they were pretty much meaningless, not worth fretting over. Of course, our feeble human minds work relatively and not absolutely, so I felt the worry and stress over these things all the same. But, I learned to stop taking these feelings seriously, which made me get over them soon enough. And even if the problem is serious, as they can be, even in my easy life - why freak out over it? At its core, this is simple, as all these principles are: accept what you cannot change, change the rest for the best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;beempathetic&quot;&gt;Be Empathetic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in, keep in mind you are not special, every single other human has an inner life too. Because of the way each of us is a little mind trapped in a physical cage allowing only indirect and grossly physical communication, it can be hard to fathom that in this world there are more than 7 billion other people who think and feel and worry and try and wonder constantly, just as you do. Each of these people had led a life with as many memories, incidents, relationships, and just - as much living, as you. Well, more or less. Just think about that. This is mindbogglingly complex to fathom, so practicality dictates we interact with most people through simple representation of their inner life, basic versions sufficient for the situation. And that works, and that makes sense. But, it is still important to remember that these conceptions are nothing more than mental cardboard cut outs of real people, and no person is actually that simple, ever. The ethical and practical aspects aside, remembering this makes existence all that more wondrous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, likewise, it is important to remember that people interacting with you have no access to you inner life, and have no obligation to work to understand it, just as you do not have an obligation to work to understand theirs. In every challenge and failure we face, we have a deep understanding of our struggle, of ourselves. And yet, we must understand that others do not, and their response reflects that. Basically: people are not psychic, so don’t expect them to be, and don’t expect them to try to be. We should expect those close to us to understand us somewhat, perhaps, but feeling it unfair for others not to understand or care for your inner narrative in times of challenge and crisis is a vestige of childhood we must all abandon to become reliable individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;beintrospective&quot;&gt;Be Introspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in, just take time to think about your life. Try to get some consistent thoughts on being of your own. Reflection can be difficult, it takes work, and humbleness, and discipline. But, in life everything is a matter of balance, and in that we must be capable of detecting imbalance. Everyone knows open-loop control just does not work well. Stated less obliquely, everyone knows a problem has to be recognized before it can be fixed. Such as, for example, the problem of worrying irrationally. Oh yes - it seems almost all these principles are in their core just a twist on introspection.
So just do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;beauthentic&quot;&gt;Be Authentic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in, be yourself, seriously. Or, more specifically, work to be yourself. Obviously, practicality or etiquette or ethics often call for truth to be withheld, or replaced. But, so do confusion, convention, convenience, and so many more crutches. Forget ethics, being dishonest on account of these things is just lame, is as Holden Caulfield so often noted ‘phony.’ Being lame is often easier and safer, true, but also unambitious, boring, disappointing. And that makes for depressing lives, devoid of Truth and Beauty and Passion and Discovery - safe, but sad. So, work to avoid it, to surpass the easy decisions, the easy thoughts, the easy interactions that are hollow and false. If you are reading this, chances are you can afford the effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;be-wary-of-complexity&quot;&gt;Be Wary of Complexity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in, stop lying to yourself, usually things actually do not have to be so very complicated. Though I express these thoughts on being in part because I think they are non-obvious and took me a lot of time to discover and internalize, the truth is the most striking realization is that the most important lessons in my life were taught to me as a child. Just be yourself, don’t worry about things you cannot change, take each failure as a learning opportunity, forgive but not forget, be kind to people, etc. These things are simple, and they seem True and Good, and yet how few of us seem to manage to actually follow them. But, I also write these thoughts on being because I think that with enough confidence and resolution it is possible to cut through the haze of self delusion and confusion and find some things to believe in, and commit to, and abide by, and eventually live a life free of existential dread and absurdist confusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;be-wary-ofself-pity&quot;&gt;Be Wary of Self Pity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in, be wary of self pity disguised as misery. In regards to worrying about grades, I eventually started to wonder: if I know that in getting a bad grade I can do nothing about it but work harder and do better next time, why sense is there to feeling bad about it, to beating myself up over it? There really was no sense to it, but I felt compelled to do it, why? I came to think the reason is this: I sought to absolve myself of the failure, to prove my ‘innocence’ and related lack of justification for said failure by feeling pain over it and punishing myself for it - I really did care, I did not deserve it, it’s not fair. But, again, that’s nonsense - what I should do is move on and do better.  This plays into a bigger principle:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;we-are-all-tiny-specks-in-this-universe-and-the-universedoes-not-even-begin-to-care-about-us-and-it-is-unfair-and-our-lives-are-unfair---deal-with-it&quot;&gt;We Are All Tiny Specks In This Universe, and the Universe Does Not Even Begin to Care About Us, and it is Unfair, and Our Lives are Unfair - Deal With it&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, a children’s lesson - the world ain’t fair. Any and all indignation about the fact is not going to change it, and is a waste of time and energy. Instead, we must learn to appreciate it all as it is - kind of fucked up, certainly not ideal, but on the whole quite worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brothers is a game made by a movie director - Josef Fares . It’s nonconformity, courage, and beauty all derive significantly in part because of this esoteric source of creativity, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.polygon.com/features/2013/10/27/4864230/brothers-starbreeze-josef-fares&quot;&gt;the Polygon has greatly covered&lt;/a&gt;. Go read about it - the piece is well written, interesting, and makes playing the game all the more enjoyable. Josef Fares and Starbreeze have done something truly impressive, and should be commended for realizing a vision without regard for stale video game traditions. As is said in the article, ‘“If you want to make something that stands out and is memorable, you can’t do what everyone else is doing,” Engdal says. “It may seem obvious when stated like that, but still — most companies these days do the same thing over and over again because of some perceived sense of safety.”’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where to start? The game is set up early as being about the journey of two brothers across a medieval fantasy land to get a cure for their ailing father. The art direction needs to be praised, the music is appropriately elegant, and whoever handled creating the ground textures should get a raise. But what first really struck me was how the FEEL of a fairy tale Journey permeated this game. This is a Journey that stands among those of Jack (the climber and the Samurai), Frodo, and whoever had the courage to go after the fountain of life. It cannot be emphasized enough how much the sheer feeling of going on an exciting journey permeates this game. So many games feel empty in comparison, are a mechanical exercise to get through the next checkpoint or destination, with barely any soul or passion within them. Brothers had me jumping on noticeably protruding rocks on walls, shimmying on precarious ledges, handing and moving along slight fringes, and many such completely routine video game devices - but in this game as I started doing those acts I was excited, I felt like this was the start of an adventure instead of the same old typical progression towards the next level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, immersion. This game has no HUD or health, and it does not need them. The environmental puzzles are made to be simple and natural, quite logically embedded in the environment, so progression was almost constant and frustration almost nonexistent. This game has about 15 seconds of tutorial, as long as is required. The controls are simple, and often simply do the natural thing - keep running towards a platform to jump towards, twist the stick to turn the lever, etc. There are no points. Instead of points there are people, and places, and things to do - if you see person playing with a cat you can go over and pet it, if you see a person playing the lute you can go over and listen or mess with it slightly, if you see a fountain with fish in it you can enter and freshen up. This is what being in a world is all about. Unsurprisingly the Fares has named the designer of Ico as someone he’d like to meet, and the minimalism and design clarity here are on equal grounds with that groundbreaking game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the mechanics. By having a single “interact” button and designing the game around that, the game fights against a strong bias of games for mechanistic design. By that I mean the “feel” of a platformer, a shooter, even a puzzle game - those all about the fine tuning of those specific mechanics, and the vast majority of games are designed to be enjoyable through mastering of the mechanics and variations on them over a long stretch of gameplay. Brothers is among recent games, like Gone Home, Dear Esther, The Stanley Parable, The Novelist, and Kentucky Route Zero that lack this emphasis on the joy of the game being primarily in the mechanics, in the raw input-output experience of it. This first struck me as I was carefully avoiding piles of bones while sneaking up on a troll facing the other way to steal a key conspicuously hung on his belt - unlike so many games where just sneaking would be made into a routine mechanic, in this game the act was done once and felt good due to the narrative and emotional meaning of it rather than its mechanical execution. These game are finally creating more balance and experimentation in the medium by having plain mechanics and emphasizing the pleasures of exploration, choice, discovery, and interaction. Considering the market is flooded with shooters, platformers, and puzzle games (even of the indie variety), I am a big fan of this trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Brothers does employ game mechanics in a very important way. It frustratingly requiring both brothers to be controlled simultaneously with only the player’s one rather limited brain and two analogue sticks, which of course grows to be strangely natural over the course of the game. Much as with the very successful Papers, Please, the design of Brothers embeds much of the meaning of the game directly in the gameplay. I will avoid spoiling the ending, but it is sufficient to say that when you get to it the game has a brilliant conclusion in large part due to the mechanics of the game. Furthermore, it also allows for a fairly unique sense of enjoyment with the game when you feel your control of the two character is truly synchronized. This strongly reminded me of the concept of “flow”, and how other well designed games &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/03/a-portrait-of-the-artist-as-a-game-studio/254494/&quot;&gt;such as Flower and Journey&lt;/a&gt; elicit it strongly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are so many other things that are good in this game, and that are finally becoming more common in video games since the ongoing indie surge that has been happening at least since Braid and Limbo . Cutscenes are used sparingly, and correctly. The game as whole is short, which is to say the right length so no mechanics are tired out or pointless nonsense repetetive gamepaly is introduced. It is not sentimental, or childish, or simplistic (though whatever puzzles are in it are very intentionally simple). Forget specifics, the game as a whole is just uniquely beautiful. Play it, as soon as you can.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Wow, what a senior design project. Getting a roughly 30k robot rover and being tasked with putting roughy 5k of electronics and sensors on top of it. And the software! To make a self driving, autonomous mapping robot that precisely sprayed plants and gathered data with the possibility of remote control and monitoring. Seriously, what a project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a project - a serious enough one to the point of not being able to finish, apparently. A lot was working on that Jetson TK1, intense ROS-based SLAM code with Kinect 2 and SLAM input, navigation of the robot, and so much more (the technical docs and presentation have all the juicy details) - but as happens so often we did not pull it all together in time. Still, we were close, and for a project of such ambition that means something.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Basically, with a lot of work, particularly leading up to the paper submission. I decided to do a year long project with the ambition of being published before leaving for my summer internship with EPFL, and tentatively planned out the next year over the summer. The fall is then much of the exploration on what the research will be and the implementation of what would be needed took place, and in the final semester at Tech I actually finished the software, ran the study, and wrote the paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My work on this project counted both for completing the Research Option at Georgia Tech and for my CS Senior Research project, and correctly so - deciding on a research direction, implementing the vast majority of the necessary software, and (most of all) running a study and completing the paper all pushed me to work extremely hard despite at times being unsure the project could be completed on time and most definitely being unsure it could lead to a publication. It must be admitted that conceptually, or in terms of algorithms, the paper is not that impressive. Still, I still think it touched on several important topics that could be exploerd to a much deeper depth. And, it got published, so it seems I am not entirely wrong!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To work on the same team for four years, all during school, can you imagine? So many late nights, team dinners, missed deadlines. My involvement went up and down, and was varied - helping out the MechE people, debugging circuits, discussing design - but for the most part I did embedded programming, and ended up being software lead for two years (more or less). No one on the team can claim to have been great at meeting deadlines or not overcomplicating things, but in the end we did built a (very suboptimal) solar racing car. How did we get there? Very messily, and having made many mistakes. But, there is no doubt some of the most valuable experience I got at Tech was from working on the team - how do engineers learn to actually do anything if they don’t participate in such things in schools? Who knows.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;By senior year of college, I had a Pololu 3Pi robot I had won at a Robotics and Perception class and an Android to Arduino bridge I had won at a hackathon. I was itching to use them both, and the idea was obvious - make the robot remotely controllable with an Android device using the Arduino ADK. And that’s exactly what I did, despite the massive levels of overwork that research and senior design in concert with TAin and multiple over classes brought to me. The details are all in the report, though sadly no video evidence of this working exists - soon, though. In the meantime, i’ll leave you with some wisdom: never forget to connect your grounds!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I TA’d Intro to AI at Georgia Tech for a total of 4 semester - 2 years. As far as they go, this was an easier class to TA; the projects were autograded, we only have two tests, we had no recitation, and so on. Still, as with all classes it was imperfect, and it was up to the TAs (directed by multiple professors) to perpetually tweak the class to make it better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most significant impact I made on the class has got to be helping to implement several new projects: Constraint Satisfaction Problems, Decision Trees, and Neural Nets. Though it may seem easy, writing good projects takes a lot of effort - the directions need to be clear, the autograder needs to work, the overall structure needs to make sense, and so much more. In fact, each of our projects was slightly broken when first released! But over time, we really polished them, and in retrospect I still feel pretty good about the work we did.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Oh IOT, will you ever be useful. Being a hackathon fan, I wanted to be part of the GT Inventure prize for years, and finally assembled a team for it my senior year. The idea - to make ‘dumb’ lightswitches smart with a little stick-on lever you could control from your phone - was just silly/awesome enough to perhaps work. We first tried it at the GTHacks hackathon. It was mostly a bust, largely due to the awfulness of the then new Intel Edison, but we pressed on and got 200$ in school funding for parts for the Inventure prize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plan was ambitious - to design custom small-scale PCBs that would have the TI CC2451 chips, which could be housed in an efficiently sized light-swtiching mechanism and pair with an Android app for control. As happens so often, it was too ambitious - we only managed to get a dev kit to control a servo via a simple BLE message, and even that did not work perfectly. Still, we made it to the second round ofthe competition before being knocked out due to a poor presentation and lack of a solid prototype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did not succeed, but the fact our idea later emerged in &lt;a href=&quot;http://myswitchmate.com/&quot;&gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.engadget.com/2015/11/04/robotic-iot-fingers-make-your-dumb-appliances-smarter/&quot;&gt;different&lt;/a&gt; products does suggest we were right to try it. The truth is, we were all busy and only put in 10% of what we could have had we really dedicated to the competition, and with that in mind we really did quite that.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;It is so easy to churn out numbered lists of things that the form has become one of the internet’s junk foods. And yet, my head is full of them, all those memories and facts, and if this blog has any purpose it is to vocalize the contents of that place. So, a compromise: I present a list, but keep the words to single sentences that avoid the necessary obvious elaboration so easy to produce.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;My favorite music video of all time - the energy and dissonance of the music brilliantly and simply captured in physical reality.&lt;/figcaption&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Or, some principles I have grown to try to abide by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All things to strive for, some realistic and some less so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bedecision-driven&quot;&gt;Be Decision Driven&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in, don’t rely on motivation or external pressure to do things. There are things you want to do, there are things you need to do, there are things you merely should do. Some of these things you are afraid to do, some of them you are apathetic about, some will take years to do. So many of these things - productive things, good-for-you things, kind things - are hard to do. But they are worth doing, much more so than being paralyzed into numb time wasting as is so easy in our age of the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, force yourself to get past the easy life and do the hard things. Control yourself, feel you have a will by which to steer yourself into action. Think about what to do. Start with goals, motivations, feelings, principles, realities, but end with duties, with responsibilities, with decisions which you will follow whether you have motivation or feel like it or not. This is less unpleasant than it sounds - you will decide not only to throw yourself into work, but also to take naps, to eat snacks, to enjoy life. And, be capable of much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, it seems to be basically what a guy named Immanuel Kant argued for, and he is kind of a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Kantian ethics&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kantian_ethics&quot;&gt;Kantian ethics&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Deontological&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontological&quot;&gt;deontological&lt;/a&gt;, revolving entirely around duty rather than emotions or end goals. All actions are performed in accordance with some underlying &lt;a title=&quot;Maxim (philosophy)&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxim_(philosophy)&quot;&gt;maxim&lt;/a&gt; or principle, which are deeply different from each other; it is according to this that the moral worth of any action is judged.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;be-careful-with-feelings&quot;&gt;Be Careful With Feelings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in, don’t accept feelings as inherently true. As in, don’t let yourself worry excessively. Feelings can be nice. But they are too often foolish, ignorant, or unreasonable. Don’t trust them. Question them, scrutinize them, check them. You may not be able to control what you feel, but  you have a choice with how to respond to those feelings - to embrace the feeling or reject it. Too many seem to embrace their feelings without thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rejecting a feeling will not make it go away, true, but it will then allow you to choose to act against the feeling rather than for it. It will allow you to notice thoughts that are untrue, that are just part of a negative feedback cycle in which an unreasonable bad feeling feeds into unreasonable bad thoughts and the whole thing amplifies itself senselessly.It will allow you to choose to do things that counteract the feeling, even if you may not feel like doing that. Likewise it can help you start a positive feedback cycle - to tell yourself you can do it, that it will be fine, that everything is fine. It’s good to teach yourself to be confident, to forsake worry and push through.  In short, it will allow you to decide what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;be-yourself&quot;&gt;Be Yourself &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in, haters gonna hate.  This is a basic one. Fuck wanting to fit in, fuck social norms, fuck letting other people set your standard or opinions or views.  No one’s opinion, morals, ideas, or desires should matter more to you than your own. Don’t compare yourself to the genius or model next to you - only compare yourself against your own personal standard. Be a punk, be a rebel, be cool by your own standard - or be none of those things and fit in just fine but don’t do so because anyone told you to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But don’t confuse this with radical individualism or relativism. It is incredibly foolish, selfish, and generally morally bad to be entirely egocentric and unwilling to consider the perspective or needs of society and those around you. This just means think, question, ponder, wonder, appreciate, discover, consider, talk - all as you see fit, meaning in some ways as others see fit too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;be-ambitious-orbe-interesting&quot;&gt;Be Ambitious, Or Be Interesting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in, try to be alright with fear. As in, don’t do nothing, unless it’s for rest. Strive to think things, say things, build things, make things, create things, share things, criticize things, gift things. Things you’ll remember, things you’ll be proud of, things you were scared to do but knew you should, things that were difficult but worth it, things other have not done, things you have not done, things you are curious about, things others don’t appreciate, things you did not think you could do, things that make your life worth living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;be-wary-of-excuses&quot;&gt;Be Wary Of Excuses&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in, it’s your fault even when it is not. As in, life is unfair, deal with it. As in, explanations are good, excuses are not. It does not matter if things are stacked against you, it does not matter if the world or people or circumstance is not cooperating or not being fair, it does not matter if something was an accident. Work within reality as it is, not as it ought to be, and don’t use the discrepancy to avoid the work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;behealthy&quot;&gt;Be Healthy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in, accept that you are your body. You are inherently Human, a strange quasi-rational living body. You have no idea how any of it works. Yet for some reason you have a conscience and a feeling of free will to decide what to do, that is not just inside of this strange biological machine but emerges from it. So be well, physically. It helps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;we-are-all-doomed-toeternal-nonexistence-afterdeath-and-the-only-point-of-it-all-is-creating-meaning-where-there-is-none&quot;&gt;We Are All Doomed to Eternal Nonexistence After Death, And The Only Point of It all Is Creating Meaning Where There is None&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in, the universe is a cold machine and our pale blue dot is the only thing that gives it any meaning (as far as we know). Worse yet, we are a bunch of biological machines with built in expiration dates. But, we are the ones here to care, and that’s what matters.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Fair warning: I will not hold back on any plot details in this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The differences are staggering in retrospect. Telltale’s first season of The Walking Dead felt like a desperately needed breath of fresh air. &lt;em&gt;The Walking Dead Season 2 Finale&lt;/em&gt; treads tepid, zombie-infested water. Even in its most meaningful moments, it’s a mere approximation of what Telltale has proven itself capable of.” &lt;span style=&quot;line-height:1.5;&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style=&quot;line-height:1.5;&quot; href=&quot;http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/26/6064039/the-walking-dead-season-2-episode-5-review-no-going-back&quot;&gt;Polygon review of the finale of The Walking Dead, Season 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first season of Telltale’s adaptation of The Walking Dead is among the most praised video games of the past decade. Its focus on character relationships in a ruined world, and dialogue meant chiefly to develop those relationships, earned it acclaim despite it otherwise basically being another episodic Telltale adventure game. Though it has its flaws, it succeeds where so many games fail: having a narrative core that is emotionally rich and deeply human.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/91iAqB4pB5L.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;postimage&quot; src=&quot;/writing/images/2014-11-18-on-the-walking-dead-and-artistic-coherence/91iAqB4pB5L.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
    &lt;figcaption&gt;An illustrative wallpaper for The Walking Dead Season 1&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than focusing on the tired trope of “humans are the real monsters,” it instead focuses on humans’ capacity to be good despite having done wrong and having been wronged. More importantly, it does this &lt;strong&gt;very damn well&lt;/strong&gt;, by having a clear and consistent focus on the paternal bond that forms between the two main characters, Lee and Clementine. For once, the larger  naturally from the human story at its core.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second season looked to continue from where the last one ended, with Lee dead and the player the role of Clementine. This seemed like a natural choice: to continue with one of the core characters from the last season, with all the improved graphics and fine-tuned gameplay mechanics one can expect in a sequel. So, why is the prevailing response to it so much less positive than for the first season? I’d say, more than anything, it was the second’s lack of coherence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamerwg.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/The-Walking-Dead-Season-2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;postimage&quot; src=&quot;/writing/images/2014-11-18-on-the-walking-dead-and-artistic-coherence/The-Walking-Dead-Season-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Same  of Wallpaper, different season&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Lee unambiguously dead, Season 2 needed a new narrative element to match the first season’s focus on fatherhood and the larger elements of humanity that stood for. That, after all, is what made the whole of Season 1 and especially its ending so impressive. And this is where Season 2 fails. It still has the character drama to underscore the ’in survival, no one is the good guy’, the mundane character interactions to make the experience grounded, the swift action sequences with split-second choices to leave you stunned as the credits roll  - but in the end, the game ends up being about not much of anything besides petty character conflicts and the increasingly tiresome challenges the main character has to face (as a 12 year old, surrounded by adults, in a zombie apocalypse).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://videogamewriters.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/walkingdeadseason2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;postimage&quot; src=&quot;/writing/images/2014-11-18-on-the-walking-dead-and-artistic-coherence/walkingdeadseason2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Seasons 2 is darker than Season 1. Sadly, it is also dafter.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was not supposed to be that way. Like any good mainstream release, the game’s marketing told you what it was supposed to be about, with the mandatory hashtag properly attached: “Your choices will decide Clem’s fate. Who will YOU become? &lt;a class=&quot;_58cn&quot; href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/myclementine&quot;&gt;#MyClementine&lt;/a&gt;.” The comfortable, ever so easy video game “Who will YOU become” question - will you become a basically normal person with superhuman survival/killing skills or a ruthless stone-cold killer with superhuman survival/killing skills? Except, it is not even about that much. Spots here and there seem to think it is about that, sure, but other spots veer into being about brutish patriarchal masculinity and yet others are about dealing with the loss of loves one. Mostly though, it is about characters arguing for silly reasons and zombies coming out of nowhere so there is conflict. Its disparate notes don’t come together to be about anything bigger – it is not coherent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/tdn.com/content/tncms/images/v3/editorial/0/02/002528fa-df11-11e3-aa53-0019bb2963f4/53798e07da7d8.preview-620.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;postimage&quot; src=&quot;/writing/images/2014-11-18-on-the-  walking-dead-and-artistic-coherence/53798e07da7d8.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
    &lt;figcaption&gt;If you manage to save this character, be assured that really does not matter...&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A personal anecdote: at the mid-point of the season, I was excited – I thought, wow, there are multiple weak characters in this game interactions with whom may subtly show my true attitude to “the strong deserve to survive” philosophy of the season’s main antagonist (my stated attitude being disagreement). Nope. One character gets a weak redemptive-death ending that weakly points to the game being about masculinity and patriarchy, and the other gets an even more unceremonious death that robs her existence of any meaning. That’s the case with a lot of the season, really – drama for the sake of drama or action for the sake of action, meaning nothing for any larger arc or theme. The ending is at least appropriate; it, too, has no meaningful connection to any overarching theme of the season and instead is just dramatic and loud and violent and contrived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term ludonarrative dissonance, meaning a game’s mechanics conveying a separate message from its narrative, has become quite popular in writing about games. As well it should have, it being an important idea for the medium. But, I feel that most games still suffer the more basic and non-medium specific problem of lacking coherence. They exist to give the player some excitement and fun and maybe even a story, but those elements taken together just make a dissonant jagged mess. This often happens even when games desperately try to be about something – see Bioshock Infinite, GTA IV, GTA V (probably), Assassin’s Creed 3, Watch Dogs, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is understandable, really – mainstream game production has taken after Hollywood, with games being made more often because they are good products than because they are good ideas. But, sometimes a game like The Walking Dead Season 1 comes along, and shows that games can be coherently about something, and be smart, elegant, and heartfelt in doing so. Season 2 failed to do that, and filled that void with the sound and fury so typical of video games. Telltale’s other series, The Wolf Among Us, had significant pacing issues but was at least much more ambitious and interesting in what it strived to be about, and I think that deserved praise.  Until that happens, until more Polygon-style criticism arises and places emphasis on the larger significance and coherence of video games, they will continue to feign ambition in the form of this-is-about-this-cool-thing-except-not-really-it’s-just-a-game.&lt;/p&gt;
