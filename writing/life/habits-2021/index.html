  <p>“We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.” <br />
-Aristotle (except actually <a href="http://blogs.umb.edu/quoteunquote/2012/05/08/its-a-much-more-effective-quotation-to-attribute-it-to-aristotle-rather-than-to-will-durant/">Will Durant</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It has been 3 years since I started <a href="https://www.andreykurenkov.com/writing/life/habits/">my blog post “Habits and Tools, Old and New”</a> with that line. That’s a long time, and longer still given the nightmare that much of the past year turned out to be. Still, the quote is as true as ever, and represents as important an ideal to strive toward as ever. So, given the passage of time and the opportunities to learn from times pleasant and not, I thought to write a part 2 to that old blog post. Some things from that post still apply, others are new, some boring, some less so. So there you have it, enjoy this little summary of the things I think make my life better.</p>

<h3 id="excercise">Excercise</h3>
<p>First, a couple of things I covered in my prior post that I still stand by. By far my favorite way to excercise is to go to fitness classes. Boxing classes, yoga classes, weighlifting classes. Nothing beats being in a physical place, among other people, with loud music and a charismatic instructor, to push yourself to your limits.</p>

<figure class="sidefigureright">
      <img class="postimagesmaller" src="/writing/images/2021-05-19-habits-2021/fitbitcoach.jpg" />
     <figcaption>From the Seattle Boxing Gym, which I loved. Those big wide open spaces are for group classes.</figcaption>

</div><figcaption class="figure__caption" style="padding-top:0;"><p>From the Seattle Boxing Gym, which I loved. Those big wide open spaces are for group classes.</p>
</figcaption></figure>

<p>But, favorite though it may be, it is not always the most convenient way to excercise. Cost, time, place – lots of factors make this flavor of working out impractical. So, another bit I have stuck by for years. Simple: replace a fitness trainer with recordings of a personal trainer, and a gym with your room. YouTube works, but I prefer apps, especially FitBit Coach; good routines, good UI, good trainers, and sometimes just as free as YouTube. What’s more, no equipment at all is necessary (though some helps).</p>

<p>Now with that recap of what I liked before and what I still like now out of the way, something new. For the past year or so, I’ve found a brand new ingredient to my excercise routine: Virtual Reality. I’ve been experimenting with emerging VR technology for half a decade now, and it is only in the past year or two that it has become truly useful. Not just entertaining, but useful. Just like fitness classes, excercise games in VR (such as boxing, rhythm, and other types of games) make it easy to push yourself beyond what you thought possible.</p>

</div><figcaption class="figure__caption" style="padding-top:0;"><p>FitXR, my current favorite exercise game.</p>
</figcaption></figure>

<p>Last, most recent, and simplest: walking. In the past, i’ve always walked or biked as part of my commute to work. With COVID, that stopped being the case. Like many, I made walking outside a regular practice for a while. Presumably also like many, I eventually fell out of that habit – until recently. Now that i’m again going on a 30 minute walk every morning, I’ve grown to place a lot of value in it. Not only is it a good way to consistently be at least a bit active, but it also makes time to reflect on the goals for today, journal, and do other little tasks to get the day going well.</p>

<p>So, if nothing else, I try to keep active by walking.</p>

<h4 id="new-morning-kick-off">New: Morning Kick Off</h4>
<p>All too often, work would get heavy, I would have to pick my battles, and I’d miss the gym for days, even weeks. That does not feel good, seem good, or is good. So my new idea? Excercise for 10-15 minutes right upon waking up. Specifically, do a 10-15 Fitstar excercise. Not only does that keep me not feeling like I’ve gone for weeks without excercising, but it also makes it easier for me to wake up and get going. Not easy to keep up, but worth the effort.</p>

<h3 id="sleep">Sleep</h3>

<h4 id="new-wake-up-consistently-night-ritual">New: wake up consistently, night ritual</h4>
<p>This is a tough one. Since the end of high school, I have never managed to wake up at a consistent time. Not even when I started working as a software engineer - my initial enthusiasm for showing up early quickly faded and I went back to winging it based on how I felt on the day. Turns out, not waking up at a consistent time makes it hard to have a consistent morning routine, and a morning routine is pretty important for having a routine at all. And, it makes it harder to wake up at all. So, time for fancy alarm clocks, lights that turn on at the same time as the alarm, all that.</p>

<figure class="figure"><div class="figure__main">
<p><a href="/writing/images/2018-01-26-habits/sleep_from_to.png"><img class="postimagesmall" style="width:40%;" src="/writing/images/2018-01-26-habits/sleep_from_to.png" alt="Sleep From To" /></a></p>
</div><figcaption class="figure__caption" style="padding-top:0;"><p>Pretty crazy, right?</p>
</figcaption></figure>

<p>But, more importantly, I have decided to have better sleep. Specifically, to fall asleep more easily and calmly. And so, I decided to stick to the whole array of recommended pre-sleep activities - dim the lights, don’t look at screens, drink special sleep-time tea with honey, read. And it’s great! Commiting to spending the last half hour prior to sleep in this fashion has made me feel far more tranquil as I go to sleep than I used to.</p>

</div><figcaption class="figure__caption" style="padding-top:0;"><p>Highly recommended</p>
</figcaption></figure>

<h3 id="excercise-1">Excercise</h3>

<h3 id="diet">Diet</h3>

<h4 id="old-soylent">Old: Soylent</h4>
<p>I already <a href="http://www.andreykurenkov.com/writing/art/why-i-consume-soylent/">made my case for Soylent</a> (TDLR - convenient, healthy, affordable, futuristic, makes real food taste even better), and years later the case still holds up. More than holds up, actually - with the introduction of Soylent 2.0 and Soylent Coffee and Cocoa, the convenience and flavor have both seen a significant boost in the past few years. Most I tell this still scoff, but whenever I am so inconvenienced as to have to eat real food for lunch I am reminded of how much time it gets just to get food and how sluggish I feel afterwards.</p>

<figure class="figure"><div class="figure__main">
<p><a href="/writing/images/2018-01-26-habits/soylent.jpg"><img class="postimageactual" src="/writing/images/2018-01-26-habits/soylent.jpg" alt="Soylent" /></a></p>
</div><figcaption class="figure__caption" style="padding-top:0;"><p>A photo from years ago. I still have about this many bottles at home at the start of every month.</p>
</figcaption></figure>

<h4 id="new-meal-squares">New: Meal squares</h4>
<p>But, let’s face it, drinking two bottles of nutritious goo can get a bit repititious. So, I was most excited by my recent discovery of MealSquares. These little nutrition bricks are dry, dense, and chalky - but also contain bits of chocolate, and go down fantastically when paired with a drink such as tea (or Soylent!).</p>

</div><figcaption class="figure__caption" style="padding-top:0;"><p>My Current Lunch</p>
</figcaption></figure>

<h3 id="mental-health">Mental Health</h3>

<h4 id="old-meditation">Old: Meditation</h4>
<p>This too, <a href="http://www.andreykurenkov.com/writing/life/some-thoughts-on-meditation/">I have written about</a>. More and more, I am convinced that meditation will gradually become as commonly acknowledged as a crucial component of a healthy life as physical excercise. Nowdays it’s easier than ever to start - Calm, Headspace, and many other apps tout their ability to teach you the magical skill of meditation. I used both Calm and Headspace early on, and do recommend them for getting started. But I quickly found their idea of ‘listen to lectures about life’ to be pretty far removed from actual meditation, and largely rely on the far simpler Insight Timer.</p>

<figure class="figure"><div class="figure__main">
<p><a href="/writing/images/2018-01-26-habits/meditation.png"><img class="postimagesmaller" src="/writing/images/2018-01-26-habits/meditation.png" alt="Meditation" /></a></p>
</div><figcaption class="figure__caption" style="padding-top:0;"><p>I have not been the best at this… but trying to get better.</p>
</figcaption></figure>

<h4 id="new-gratitude-journaling">New: Gratitude Journaling</h4>
<p>I started keeping a journal more than a year ago now. Not for mental health reasons, just for… fun. Something I found when catching up on this journaling (sometimes whole weeks at a time, sometimes even more), is that trying to recall some fun event from a while ago almost made me feel like how I felt when it actually happened. Furthermore, consistently writing down this journal just made me appreciate the mundane little milestones of life just a little more.</p>

<figure class="figure"><div class="figure__main">
<p><a href="/writing/images/2018-01-26-habits/journal.png"><img class="postimagesmaller" src="/writing/images/2018-01-26-habits/journal.png" alt="Journal" /></a></p>
</div><figcaption class="figure__caption" style="padding-top:0;"><p>Just about the year mark, these started showing up. I use the Journey app, which I recommend, though there are many good options.</p>
</figcaption></figure>

<p>So I was not surprised to find out there was another surprisingly simple scientificaly backed way of maintaing mental health - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratitude_journal">gratitude journaling</a>. It used to be this would seem to touchy-feely for me, but no more. My plan, given my whole experience with journaling, is to stick to the weekly cadence by writing down some things I am grateful for from the past week. Too early to tell if I’ll stick to this, but I am eager to try it out for this next year.</p>

<h3 id="productivity">Productivity</h3>

<h4 id="old-email-cleaning-calendar-onenote-habitbull">Old: Email Cleaning, Calendar, OneNote, HabitBull</h4>

<p>This stuff is boring but useful, so let’s keep it brief:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I try to keep my email inbox nearly empty, so every email still not deleted or categorized to a folder is an ongoing TODO item. Having an empty inbox is rare, and feels great. I’ve tried to use Inbox’s whole email snoozing stuff off and on, but find it’s overkill most of the time.</li>
  <li>I used to be terrible about keeping a calendar, but forgetting some significant things last year made me come around - I now track my meetings, classes, everything.</li>
  <li>I’ve tried different approaches to note taking, idea tracking, info dumping, all that. OneNote’s is the one I prefer by far. The idea of having a notebook with various sections and pages within each section just works wonderfully for a great many applications.</li>
</ul>
<figure class="figure"><div class="figure__main">
<p><a href="/writing/images/2018-01-26-habits/onenote.png"><img class="postimagesmall" src="/writing/images/2018-01-26-habits/onenote.png" alt="OneNote" /></a></p>
</div><figcaption class="figure__caption" style="padding-top:0;"><p>All the stuff I have been meaning to get around to writing for years, and have yet to write.</p>
</figcaption></figure>
<ul>
  <li>I first started thinking about my habits years ago, and figured there must be a to-do app that captures the entirely intuitive ‘secret’ (<a href="https://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret">often attributed to Jerry Seinfeld</a>) that having a streak to keep going is a good motivator. Today that is indeed the case, there are dozens of apps for this, but a few years ago HabitBull (now called Habit Tracker) was one of very few. I started using it years ago and still use it today.</li>
</ul>
<figure class="figure"><div class="figure__main">
<p><a href="/writing/images/2018-01-26-habits/habitbull.png"><img class="postimagesmaller" src="/writing/images/2018-01-26-habits/habitbull.png" alt="HabitBull" /></a></p>
</div><figcaption class="figure__caption" style="padding-top:0;"><p>A good week!</p>
</figcaption></figure>

<h4 id="new-todoist-rescuetime">New: todoist, rescuetime</h4>
<p>Despite having this email and OneNote and Calendar system, I was still not as productive as I wanted. I found that I never managed to make time for stuff like writing for this blog, and often forgot smaller chores til far too late. So this year I had a new idea: spend 5-10 minutes in the morning reflecting on my goal for the day, and jot them down in a todo app. I had always found todo apps pretty useless, as I inevitably got behind and abandoned the endeavour. So this time, I plan to stick to keeping the todo items on at most a day-week timeline, and striving for zero tasks just as with my email inbox. This has already paid off in just a few weeks, with me being better able to keep track of various small chores as well as get around to things like writing the very text you are reading.</p>

<figure class="figure"><div class="figure__main">
<p><a href="/writing/images/2018-01-26-habits/todoist.png"><img class="postimagesmaller" src="/writing/images/2018-01-26-habits/todoist.png" alt="Todoist" /></a></p>
</div><figcaption class="figure__caption" style="padding-top:0;"><p>My TODO app, Todoist. Works like a charm.</p>
</figcaption></figure>

<p>As you may have noticed, this post has quite a few metrics and graphs. Partly this is just for fun, but I do also think that the knowledge that these metrics and graphs are out there serves as extra motivation to follow through on my ambitions. Inspired somewhat by <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/2014/08/03/quantifying-productivity/">Andrej Karpathy</a>, I decided to take this to the next level this year with <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/">rescuetime</a>. Basically, it logs every single thing I do on my phone and computer, and tells me how much time I spend doing things that are productive (like this) or unproductive (like browsing reddit). I honestly doubt it being there will change my behavior much, but then again I have felt that it has gotten me to visit distracting websites already so I may be wrong there.</p>

<h2 id="closure">Closure</h2>
<p>So there you had it, an infodump on all the habits I have cultivated and plan to cultivate, along with the best tools for said cultivation. Hopefully, if you were so inclined as to read all this a few of these might prove a fruitful addition to your own life.</p>
