> "I love writing. I get a kick out of sharing my thoughts with others. The act of transforming ideas into words is an amazingly efficient way to solidify and refine your thoughts about a given topic. " -Tom Preston (creator of Jekyll), [Blogging Like a Hacker](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html)

I am a 22 year old recent college grad that likes to appreciate art and strives to solve meaningful engineering problems that can help humanity progress. Specifically, I am interested in: machine learning (increasingly, the fast improving unsupervised kind), cinema (Tarkovsky, Aronofsky, Kaufman, Kurosawa, Bergman, Carruth, Kon, Miyazaki, Zvyagintsev, etc.), robotics (particularly, intelligent and responsive robotics that can interact with humans), robots outside the lab and in society (particularly, low cost specialized robots that can realistically be produced and be useful today), narrative-driven video games (all the indie stuff, and the Mass Effect-type stuff, and so on), energy efficiency and management (this is what led me to my EE degree, and though I dislike power engineering I care about systems that use a lot of energy), books (hard science fiction, modernist, some post-modernist, some pre-modernist), programming (especially embedded programming, but also scripting and hackathon types things as well), and so on with ever more specific ones. As you can see by the previous sentence, I have a habit for overlong self-indulgent writing heavy on parenthesis, so I decided to start writing down some of my thoughts in this blog with intention of becoming a better and faster writer. And for fun, too.
