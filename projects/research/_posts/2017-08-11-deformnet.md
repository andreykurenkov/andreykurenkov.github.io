when: January 2017-May 2017
what: A novel idea of incorporating 3D deformation of point cloud in a deep learned model, applied to 3D reconstruction
who: Andrey Kurenkov, Jingwei Ji, Animesh Garg, Viraj Mehta, JunYoung Gwak, Christopher Choy, Silvio Savarese
why: Deformations from similar objets based on shape retrieval is an intuitively reasonable approach to 3D reconstruction, and so this was a good idea.
where: Stanford, at the Stanford Vision Lab (SVL)

I was not the one to have the original idea, but mostly the one to grind out and iterate a lot to get it working. See the Arxiv post and website for more details.
