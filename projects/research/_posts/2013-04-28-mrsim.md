How indeed. Implementing an efficient single-core program to estimate large scale data processing with enough
detail to actually produce useful results is a challenging problem. Not only that, but we soon found similar things existed:
+ SimMR: Univ. of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; HP Labs
  Narrowly focused on scheduler selection and Map/Reduce slot allocation
+ Rumen/Mumak: Hadoop
  Powered by a previous job trace
  Narrowly focused on scheduler selection
+ MRSim: Brunel University
  Many hardcoded properties (limited extensibility)
+ MRPerf: Virginia Tech; IBM
  Flexibility limited to certain configurable items

Ultimately, we implemented an impressively modular and extensible simulation engine but failed to built in much of the
detail required to make it useful. Still, despite not doing anything impressive (in my view), we got the second place for
best poster among those presenting and ended up with some nice looking results.
