excerpt: Robotic Grasp Transfer Done Via Deep-Learning Powered Deformation
image:
  teaser: icon.png
  feature: poster.png
when: May 2017-Nov 2017
what: An intuitive extension of the prior DeformNet work to do grasp transfer.
who: Andrey Kurenkov, Animesh Garg, Viraj Mehta
why: Transfer has a lot more benefits over grasp planning, and doing so via deformation with the powerful DeformNet model just made sense.
where: Stanford Vision Lab

A project that did not ultimately pan out quite as succesfully as one might have hoped - but that's research! Getting to present the work at CoRL was still great, though.
