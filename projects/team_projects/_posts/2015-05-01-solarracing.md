To work on the same team for four years, all during school, can you imagine? So many late nights, team dinners, missed deadlines. My involvement went up and down, I ended up being software lead, but we did end up with a (very suboptimal) solar racing car. How did we get there? Very messily, and having made many mistakes. But, there is no doubt some of the most valuable experience I got at Tech was from working on the team - how do engineers learn to actually do anything if they don't participate in such things in schools? Who knows.
