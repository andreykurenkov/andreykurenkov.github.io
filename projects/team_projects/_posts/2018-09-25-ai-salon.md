AI Salon is a roughly bi-weekly event on Fridays where the AI Lab gathers to discuss high-level topics in AI and machine learning. The goal is to encourage ourselves to think beyond our individual day-to-day research, and better see how our work fits into the long-term trajectory of scientific progress, and into society as a whole. Each Salon has a different topic for discussion, which is led by two speakers: typically one expert guest, and one AI Lab member. We hold the event in the spirit of Enlightenment-era salons, with no electronics or whiteboard allowed: only free-ranging discussion among attendees, starting with a 10-minute opening statement from the two speakers.
