The old fashioned way - clicking and dragging and rule checking until it finally all worked, after many frustrating evenings. Despite being much more into programming and AI than the low levels of EE, somehow I quite enjoyed the practice of VLSI. If nothing else, the sheer difficulty and scope of this project reminded me how easy most CS classes were, and how I wish they pushed me to do larger and cooler things.
