By senior year of college, I had a Pololu 3Pi robot I had won at a Robotics and Perception class and an Android to Arduino bridge I had won at a hackathon. I was itching to use them both, and the idea was obvious - make the robot remotely controllable with an Android device using the Arduino ADK. And that's exactly what I did, despite the massive levels of overwork that research and senior design in concert with TAin and multiple over classes brought to me. The details are all in the report, though sadly no video evidence of this working exists - soon, though. In the meantime, i'll leave you with some wisdom: never forget to connect your grounds!
