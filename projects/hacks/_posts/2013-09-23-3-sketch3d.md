I have had many overly ambitious ideas, and this was no exception. To use your fingers, or some specially colored wand, to produce 3D models on a tablet/smartphone using only the front facing camera. Ah, my hubris - full 3D tracking with just a low res front camera in real time? But, what ruined us turned out to not be the Computer Vision - we decided early on to do simple color blob tracking, and got it work fairly early on. What failed us, unexpectedly, was the 3D graphics; as I learned then, and learned again and again, sometimes things just don't work for no clear reason. Luckily, gesture based control is pretty silly anyway, and getting to go to MHacks was very fun.
